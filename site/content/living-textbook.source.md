## How to read the living boxes {#how-to-read-the-living-boxes .unnumbered}

Seven boxes appear throughout this book. They are not decoration; they are the difference between a textbook and a press release. Editorial status is not their job --- that is stated once on the previous page and stamped on every page footer. These boxes carry *evidential* status, which is a separate axis and the one that must never slip.

###### Why theorems carry two numbers.

The corpus --- `directives/`, the claim sheet, the papers --- has called these results *Theorem 1*, *Theorem 1$''$*, *Theorem 2* and *Theorem 3* since before this book existed, and external notes cite them that way. LaTeX numbers theorems by chapter. Rather than break either convention, each theorem prints both: Theorem 9.1 of this book is also corpus Theorem 1. If you are following a reference from the claim sheet, match on the corpus name; if you are reading straight through, use the chapter number.

# How This Book Lives

## Preface {#ch:preface}

This book is a *scaffold* for a subject that did not have a name until the laboratory forced one. It is not a finished textbook. It is not ready to teach.

Universities already teach *reconfigurable computing*: LUTs, interconnect, place-and-route, FPGA fabrics, high-level synthesis. They already teach *applied cryptography*: AES, RSA, lattices, sometimes a lecture on fully homomorphic encryption. They almost never teach what happens when the reconfigurable fabric *is* a machine-learning graph API, the configuration is a Yosys netlist (not an FPGA bitstream---see Chapter [2](#ch:reconf){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:reconf"}), and the values on the wires are torus samples that must remain encrypted while a host clock ticks flip-flops.

That intersection is the intended subject of a future course. We call the working stack **HELUT**---Homomorphic Edge Look-Up Tensors---and we call the subject **reconfigurable homomorphic computing**.

The stack has three pillars [@helut-release; @helut-paper]:

1.  **Netlist-clocked torus FHE.** Gate-level sequential circuits evaluate as exact $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}$ tensor graphs, with real bootstrapping-key blind rotation and machine-checkable certificates.

2.  **Differentiable hardware cryptanalysis.** Discrete INIT tables melt into continuous tensors; a $\lambda$-squeeze grades shatter versus hold; reciprocal structure that combinatoric sieves miss can reappear as an involution.

3.  **Adversarial polymorphic ciphers.** Blue ciphers co-evolve under Red pressure and fail closed, rather than waiting to become the next historically leaked stream cipher.

###### Why a living textbook.

Research papers freeze a slice of a laboratory. This course cannot. The claim inventory [@helut-claim-sheet] moves: Metal kernels get faster, hedges close, avenues stay unlabeled until they earn receipts. If this scaffold ever becomes a course, a professor who taught from a PDF dated June would be teaching a different Metal compiler than a professor teaching from August. So the book is versioned against the corpus *epoch* (2026-08-20 / C69 in this edition) and is honest about stubs.

###### What this edition is.

Edition 0.1.2 is an AI-bootstrapped collecting place: theorems, formulae, claim IDs, and lab receipts as they land---aspirational and future-forward, not a syllabus you can run next semester. Pillar chapters exist so humans have something to vet, bulk up, fill in, and rewrite. It is a long-term project. Where the laboratory is thin, the page says so.

###### What this edition is not.

It is not a claim that HELUT invented TFHE [@chillotti2020tfhe; @ducas2015fhew]. It is not a production key-size manual. Sage filled the estimator JSON (**C23**); **H1** remains because four of eight calibration anchors disagree with Cost `rop` by more than 16 bits, which is why "176-bit secure" is not a sentence this corpus supports. It is not a decrypt of U-534 / P1030680. It is not a side-channel paper. Those sentences are printed again in Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"} because students will forget them the week before the final.

###### This edition is a draft, and it is AI-generated.

The TeX tree was bootstrapped with AI under human architectural direction (see `AI_DISCLOSURE.md`). That is not the same as human authorship of a course. Chapters will be wrong---sometimes in large ways---until people diff them against the claim sheet, fill the stubs, and rewrite the lecture voice. If a box and the sheet disagree, the sheet wins; file an issue or patch the `.tex`. Do not treat an epoch bump as proof the PDF was ready for a classroom. **Do not hallucinate the math.** A new theorem, lemma, or claim ID is a draft until a human has checked it against the inventory and a log; it does not belong in a git commit until then- at least going forward. We will have to catch up on commits up to now.

###### Who wrote it.

The HELUT project at Digital Defiance. The scientific voice of the book is the same voice as the research-release doctrine: lead with what runs, and with what it does not prove. The prose itself still needs human editors.

###### How to cite an epoch.

Cite the git commit and the claim-sheet epoch, not "the HELUT textbook" as if it were a static ISBN. When a student reproduces **C18**, they are reproducing a dated Metal NTT persist tile, not an eternal constant of nature.

## To the instructor {#ch:instructor}

Do not teach from this PDF. This chapter is a briefing for a course that does not exist yet: it is not in the ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines, and this book is not ready to put in front of students. The pages that follow are an aspirational skeleton---grading weights, tracks, a fifteen-week outline---so that when humans have vetted and filled the rest of the volume, the pedagogy has a place to live. Until then, treat this chapter as a design note, not an instructor's manual.

### The course in one paragraph

Students learn to treat a *synthesized gate netlist* as the universal intermediate representation of reconfigurable computing, to lower that netlist onto a *tensor engine* (here: Apple Silicon `MPSGraph`), and to evaluate it either as a boolean-faithful oracle or as torus FHE with certificates. They then learn a second compiler direction---melting discrete hardware into continuous tensors---and a third: designing ciphers that are born under adversarial pressure. The moral of the course is not "FHE is fast on a laptop." The moral is: *reconfigurable computing has a new fabric, and honesty about what that fabric proves is part of the engineering.*

### Prerequisites

::: center
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Required**       Digital logic (LUTs, flip-flops, timing) [@harris2012digital]; linear algebra; a first crypto course (modular arithmetic, attack models) [@paar2009crypto].
  **Helpful**        One HDL (Verilog or VHDL); one systems language; Yosys as a black box [@yosys].
  **Not required**   Prior FHE, prior Metal, prior Swift, prior lattice cryptography. The torus chapter is self-contained at the level this course needs.
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

### Two tracks

Not every department can put an M-series Mac in front of every student.

Systems track.

: Apple Silicon laboratory. Students build, tick, and certificate-read HELUT from `REPRODUCE.md`. Labs [2](#ch:lab){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:lab"} assume this track.

Theory track.

: No GPU required. Students work the five-cell test, noise lemmas, and published logs as *data*. A department can still grade a claim-audit final (below).

A mixed offering works: theory problem sets for everyone; systems labs as a project option or a second section.

### Suggested grading

::: center
  Weight   Instrument                           Why it exists
  -------- ------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  30%      Problem sets                         Negacyclic arithmetic, packing, certificate reading.
  40%      Laboratories or theory equivalents   Receipts, not vibes.
  20%      **Claim audit**                      Take a public sentence; run the five-cell test from Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"}. Fail the assignment if the student upgrades a hedge to a theorem.
  10%      Frontier essay                       Pick one avenue from Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}. Must label it frontier. Must propose the *first experiment* that would graduate it.
:::

The claim audit is the signature assignment of this course. It trains the skill the field currently lacks: refusing to launder an open hedge into a keynote.

### What to lecture, what to assign as reading

- **Lecture** Parts II--III (foundations and Pillar I), the honesty chapter, and Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} (**C19**), which is stated in Chapter [1](#ch:pillarii){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillarii"} --- this chapter only refers to it.

- **Seminar** Pillar II empirics (shatter / hold, campaign as case study) and Pillar III in edition 0.1.2. Do not lecture shatter grades as if they were Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"}.

- **Do not lecture as fact** Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}. Give it as the last two seminars, with the frontier boxes left on the slides.

### How to pull a new edition mid-semester

Science will move under your feet. That is the point of a living textbook.

1.  Diff `directives/claim-sheet.md` against the epoch printed on the title page.

2.  If a new **C** row appeared, assign the matching lab receipt as a one-page addendum; do not pretend the old PDF contained it.

3.  If an **H** closed, tell the class explicitly: "this asterisk is gone; here is the log."

4.  If only frontier text moved, do not change the midterm.

Bump `\livingepoch` in `textbook/preamble.tex` when you accept an addendum. Cite git.

### Classroom norms

- Trivial / mock torus encodings are a *shape laboratory*, not FHE. Students who call the boolean oracle "encrypted computing" lose points on purpose.

- **Campaign cryptanalysis** (Enigma / P1030680) is a *case study* in Pillar II methods, not the FHE claim, and not a decrypt.

- **Do not lecture** HELUT as an unsupervised or mobile agent, a self-rewriting FPGA, or a production encrypted CPU. Those sentences fail the five-cell test of Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"}.

- **H4** Grade B is covering Track A (**C52**--**C54**), not native $k{=}1$, not `cryptoPublicMS`, not PicoRV covering at production $N$.

- Speculative systems (encrypted LLM firewalls, self-modifying dark binaries, honey-token ledgers) are ethics-and-design discussions, not implementation homework, until they have **C** rows.

## The living contract {#ch:living}

### Why a textbook needs a contract

Ordinary textbooks accrete errata. This one accretes *science*. Without a contract, the lecture slides of 2027 will still be quoting a fused `MPSGraph` megagraph that the laboratory killed in August 2026, or---worse---will quote a speculative avenue as if it were a theorem.

The contract is the research-release doctrine [@helut-release] translated into *eventual* pedagogy. Until humans have edited this volume into a real textbook, the boxes below are how the scaffold refuses to launder hedges---not a license to open a class.

### The three inventories

Every public sentence in HELUT is classified in `directives/claim-sheet.md`:

::: center
  Tag        Name                  Classroom meaning
  ---------- --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **C$n$**   Reproducible result   You may lecture it. Students may cite it. Someone else can re-run it [@helut-claim-sheet].
  **H$n$**   Open hedge            You may discuss it. You must keep the asterisk. A problem-set "true/false" that drops the asterisk is false.
  **N$n$**   Non-implication       You must actively prevent this inference. It is a common exam trap.
:::

A fourth class lives only in this book and in `directives/potential-avenues.md`:

::: center
  Frontier   Not a claim until it has a **C** row and a reproduce command. Seminar fuel. Never a midterm fact.
  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

### The five-cell test

For an atomic claim $C$, the doctrine requires all five, or $C$ is hedged:

1.  **Proof** --- lemma, reduction, or graded empirical protocol with pass/fail.

2.  **Table** --- parameters, comparisons, or grades.

3.  **Metric** --- a number with units and a bar.

4.  **Examples** --- at least two concrete, runnable instances.

5.  **Application** --- at least one end-to-end reason to care.

::: example
**Example 3.1** (Five cells for **C18**). Metal 3-prime NTT persist blind-rotate. Proof: CPU$+$Metal NTT $\equiv$ schoolbook (19 tests) plus microbench PASS bits. Table: $N\in\{64,1024\}$ s/BR versus schoolbook persist and fused-EP. Metric: $0.433\,\mathrm{s}$/BR at $N=1024$ (gpu $0.43\,\mathrm{s}$, RSS $148\,\mathrm{MiB}$). Examples: microbench identity LUT; full_adder boolean SING (**S**timuli **In**, **G**olden out---encrypted evaluation must match the cleartext netlist on the same generic vectors; see Chapter [1](#ch:pillari){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillari"}). Application: production-shaped polynomial degree on a laptop GPU graph.
:::

::: example
**Example 3.2** (Five cells for **C19**). TensorLUT continuous$\to$discrete, corpus Theorem 1, stated as Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} in Chapter [1](#ch:pillarii){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillarii"} [@helut-tensorlut-thm]. Proof: six `TensorLUTFormal.check*` lemmas, aggregated by `certificate()`. Table: lemma vs `holds`; campaign grades kept separate. Metric: $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}=0$ on unmutated baseline; $\pi=0$ on binary INIT. Examples: M4 baseline emit; freeze-core involution; blind 3-pair PASS. Application: a stecker search that cannot propose a non-reciprocal map. Asterisk: structural, not a U-534 break (**H6**).
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.1** (Claim audit). Take any sentence from a blog post, a grant abstract, or last year's slide deck about "encrypted computing on a Neural Engine." Fill the five cells or mark the sentence a non-claim. If you cannot name the log file, it is not a **C** row.
:::

### Disclosure versus discovery

::: center
                 Disclosure package                       Trajectory
  -------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Goal           Someone else re-runs what we assert      We know what to invent next
  Artifact       `REPRODUCE.md`, logs, reproduced boxes   trajectory file, Chapter [3](#ch:open){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:open"}
  Failure mode   Unreproducible hype                      Silence / no next experiment
:::

When a trajectory item graduates, it earns a **C** row (or a tightened **H**) and a reproduce command---*then* it may enter lecture voice. That sentence is the entire editorial policy of this book. An AI draft of a lemma is not a graduation: a human must check the statement before it is committed.

### Standing non-claims

Print these on the course website.

### How a chapter grows

1.  A laboratory result lands in a log under `logs/`.

2.  A **C** or **H** row is updated in the claim sheet.

3.  The matching chapter gains an example, a table row, or a converted box; `\livingepoch` bumps.

4.  The syllabus appendix does *not* automatically change. Instructors opt in (Chapter [2](#ch:instructor){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:instructor"}).

### A verdict that varies is a bug, never a parameter {#sec:determinism}

On 2026-08-15 a re-validation sweep ran every claim in this corpus five times instead of once. Two rows stopped agreeing with themselves. One of them, **C69**, was recorded as a clean negative --- an encrypted adder that failed to evaluate correctly at LWE dimension $n{=}512$ --- and it reproduced only twice in five attempts.

The tempting explanation was physical, and this book had all the vocabulary for it: the measured residual sat at $82\%$ of the decode half-gap $\delta/2$, so noise was presumably straddling the threshold. That story was written down. It was wrong.

The disproof was already in the tool's own output. Across runs of the same command the measured residual was *byte-identical* --- $B_{\mathrm{bk}} =
858\,907$ every time --- and every seed in the harness is a hardcoded constant. Identical inputs were producing different outputs.

::: warning
*Honesty note 3.1*. Before reaching for a physical explanation of an inconsistent result, check whether the computation is deterministic. A fixed-seed pipeline that returns two answers has a software defect, and no amount of noise analysis will find it.
:::

The defect was mundane and worth knowing about in any language with hash-based dictionaries. Encrypting the primary inputs walked a `Dictionary` while drawing from a shared serial random-number generator:

    for (port, bits) in inputs {                  // hash order
        wires[wire] = encryptLWE(..., rng: &rng)  // shared RNG
    }

Swift randomises dictionary hash seeds per process, so every run assigned a different mask vector to a different wire. Ciphertexts differed, the noise realisation differed, and wherever the margin was thin the decode became a coin toss. Sorting the iteration fixed it, and the withdrawn negative became a pass.

Three details generalise beyond this repository:

- **The concurrency was innocent.** The obvious suspect was a parallel evaluation loop added for throughput. Forcing it serial changed nothing; every shared cache on the path held a correct lock. The fault was in ordinary single-threaded code.

- **Only a marginal experiment could see it.** Under a noiseless bootstrap key the blind rotation cancels the input mask exactly, so the outputs are identical whichever mask was drawn. The bug was invisible except where noise made masks matter --- which is to say, invisible except near a bar.

- **One run cannot detect it.** Hash-order dependence is a property of a *process*, so it does not appear in a single receipt, in code review, or in a test suite that runs each case once.

# Foundations of the Subject

## A new subject {#ch:subject}

### The gap between two mature fields

Reconfigurable computing classically means: a designer writes RTL, a synthesizer emits LUTs and flip-flops, a bitstream configures an FPGA, and the fabric evaluates the circuit at a clock [@harris2012digital; @gajski2009embedded]. The fabric is spatially wired. The configuration is a bitstream. The values on the wires are bits.

Fully homomorphic encryption classically means: a scheme evaluates circuits *on ciphertexts* [@chillotti2020tfhe; @ducas2015fhew]. The "fabric" is an arithmetic library---NTT butterflies, key-switching decompositions, bootstrapping. The configuration is a parameter set. The values on the wires are polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^N+1)$.

Each field has textbooks. The composition does not.

::: definition
**Definition 1.1** (Reconfigurable homomorphic computing). The study of compiling *already-synthesized* sequential netlists onto *tensor engines* so that LUT evaluation, flip-flop clocking, and (when claimed) torus FHE occupy the same graph object, with explicit certificates of what the graph does and does not prove.
:::

HELUT is one laboratory realization of that definition: Yosys JSON in, `MPSGraph` out, host posedge clock, LWE/GLWE samples on the FHE path [@helut-paper]. Apple Silicon was the *first* engine because the architect needed that graph hardware to brute-force the $\lambda$-squeeze and synthesis loops --- not because the subject is a Mac API. The definition does not name Apple. A CPU-only restatement of Theorem 1 is `python3 Scripts/tensorlut_math_ref.py`. CUDA and other fabrics remain trajectory until they have **C** rows (`directives/why-apple-silicon.md`).

### Three questions that open the course

1.  **Representation.** Can a commodity ML graph API host exact modular arithmetic at $q=2^{32}$, or does the API silently round?

2.  **Clocking.** Can sequential logic---enables, sync resets, a RISC-V core---tick on that graph without the host becoming a bit-banged FPGA?

3.  **Honesty.** When the same object grows a real bootstrapping key, what certificates must ship with every tick, and which sentences does the evidence still not support?

Pillar I is the constructive answer to (1)--(3). Pillar II asks a fourth question the FPGA curriculum never asked: *what if the INIT table is not binary?* Pillar III asks a fifth: *what if the circuit under evaluation is allowed to mutate because the attacker in the next room is the same compiler?*

### Why "reconfigurable" is the right word

An FPGA is reconfigurable because the LUT INIT bits and the interconnect are late-bound. HELUT is reconfigurable in the same sense, with three substitutions:

::: center
  Classical FPGA       This course                   Consequence
  -------------------- ----------------------------- --------------------------------------
  LUT INIT bitstream   Yosys `$lut` truth table      Same IR
  Routing fabric       Tensor edges in one graph     Place-and-route becomes lowering
  Clock tree           Host `graph.run` loop         Timing closure becomes tick protocol
  IOB / BRAM           Placeholders and MTLBuffers   Memory is unified, not dual-port
  Encrypted?           Optional; certificate-gated   Oracle $\neq$ FHE
:::

The last row is the pedagogical load-bearing wall. Students who have built FPGAs want to say "the CPU is encrypted" the moment PicoRV32 ticks. The boolean oracle path *does* clock PicoRV32 on ciphertext-*shaped* vectors (**C1**). The FHE path *does* fetch NOPs on encrypted PicoRV32 at demo $N{=}8$ (**C47** CPU, **C51** Metal): the PC walks, decrypted $Q$ matches cleartext, and calibrated hardness is $4.0$ bits---not the production $175.7$ row. Covering noisy BK at $N{=}1024$ on that core is not claimed. Chapter [3](#ch:certs){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:certs"} exists so that confusion is a grading event rather than a press cycle.

### The three pillars as a curriculum, not a brand

Roadmap language names them the Turing pillar, the Schneier pillar, and a grand challenge on proving circuits [@helut-trajectory]. In this course they are simply I, II, III, in the order a student can verify them:

- Without I, II is a float32 netlist toy and III has nowhere to run.

- Without II, I is a compiler course with FHE homework.

- Without III, I and II only attack the past; they do not design the next cipher under fire.

Edition 0.1.2 treats Pillar I in lecture depth, Pillar II Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} (**C19**, stated in Chapter [1](#ch:pillarii){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillarii"}) in lecture depth with empirics in seminar, Pillar III in seminar depth, and the grand-challenge / side-channel items as labeled frontier (Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}).

### Related systems, scoped not ranked

::: center
  System                   Exact $q{=}2^{32}$ Metal   Netlist clock   BK `$lut` FHE   Diff. hardware
  ----------------------- -------------------------- --------------- --------------- ----------------

  OpenFHE / HElib                     --               circuit API         yes              --
  HELUT boolean oracle               yes                   yes             --               --

:::

This is a *scope* matrix, not a throughput bake-off [@helut-paper]. The encrypted-path "yes" is GGSW `$lut` FHE as certified (**C4**--**C6**, covering **C52**--**C54**); it is not PicoRV covering at production $N$. Concrete is a production TFHE compiler; HELUT is a netlist-clocked tensor fabric with an FHE path. Students comparing "ms/gate" across those rows without naming encoding, $N$, and certificate status fail the five-cell test.

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.1**. Write four sentences, one per row of the matrix, that a journalist could print without creating a **N**. Then write the one-sentence lie each row most tempts.
:::

## Netlists as the universal IR {#ch:reconf}

### From RTL to LUTs

A combinational Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}$ is exactly a truth table of $2^k$ bits. FPGA vendors package that table as a $k$-input look-up table. Yosys [@yosys] emits the same object after `abc -lut 2` (or 4, or 6) as a cell of type `$lut` with a parameter string INIT.

::: definition
**Definition 2.1** (Yosys `$lut`). A combinational cell whose output bit is INIT indexed by the concatenated input bits. HELUT treats every `$lut` as one programmable gate, whether the backend is a multilinear oracle or a TFHE blind rotate.
:::

Sequential logic is a `$_DFF*` (or enable / sync-reset variant). The clock is not a net in the tensor graph: it is a *host protocol* (Chapter [1](#ch:pillari){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillari"}). That substitution---clock as protocol, not as a routed tree---is the first reconfigurable-computing heresy of the course, and it is load-bearing. Tensor engines do not give you a global posedge. They give you `graph.run`.

### Why we start from synthesized netlists

High-level FHE compilers start from a language and lower to homomorphic ops. HELUT starts from a *netlist that already exists*: PicoRV32, a regex DFA, a decision tree, an Enigma core [@picorv32]. The pedagogical reason is the same as the systems reason:

- The IR is stable. Verilog front-ends change; `$lut` does not.

- Sequential depth is explicit. Multiplicative depth in an arithmetic circuit is a metaphor; DFF count is a fact.

- Any HDL, any synthesizer that can emit Yosys JSON, is in scope.

- Cryptanalysis targets (historical machines, stream ciphers) already *are* netlists.

::: remark
*Remark 2.1*. Starting from netlists does not make HELUT "better than Concrete." It makes it a different compiler problem: *spatial* Boolean fabric onto a graph API, not *scalar* program onto PBS.
:::

### The four objects a student must be able to draw

1.  **A LUT** as a box with INIT and $k$ wires.

2.  **A DFF** as a box whose $Q$ at tick $t+1$ is a mux of $D$, enable, and reset, evaluated *between* graph runs.

3.  **A batch axis $B$** as $B$ independent copies of the same fabric in one run---the reconfigurable analog of SIMD, and the reason a Bombe search is a tensor problem.

4.  **A polynomial degree $N$** as the *ciphertext shape*, not the circuit size. $N=1$ is clear-shape boolean. $N=1024$ is TFHE-shaped. Confusing $N$ with LUT count is the most common homework error in week 2.

### Worked lowering: a half-adder

A half-adder is two gates: $\mathrm{sum}=A\oplus B$, $\mathrm{carry}=A\land B$. Under *additive torus / mock* encoding, XOR is a vector add (free). AND is a LUT (or a PBS). On the encrypted GGSW path, both gates are blind-rotates. Do not lecture "XOR is free in FHE" from this paragraph.

::: example
**Example 2.1** (Half-adder as a graph). Yosys emits (typically) one `$lut` for the AND and uses an add/xor cell or a second LUT for the sum, depending on techmap. HELUT's Phase-2 compiler [@helut-paper] lowers this to placeholders for $A,B$, an add node, a LUT node, and output binds---one persistent `MPSGraph`. There is no FPGA routing step. The "place-and-route" *is* the tensor edge list.
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 2.1**. Synthesize a 1-bit full adder with Yosys (`abc -lut 2`) and count `$lut` versus `$_DFF*` cells. Then argue, in four sentences, why the encrypted SING of that netlist is a better first FHE lab than PicoRV32. (PicoRV32 is **C1** on the *oracle* path and **C45**--**C51** on encrypted demo $N{=}8$ at $4.0$ bits; the encrypted path's production-$N$ multi-LUT workhorse is the adder, **C6** and **C20**; covering noisy adder at the same $N$ is **C52**.)

### Batch is a first-class capacity knob

On an FPGA, duplicating a circuit costs LUTs. On a tensor engine, duplicating a circuit is a batch dimension $B$ on every placeholder. Memory scales as the broadcast intermediates, not as "more CLBs."

At $N=1024$, $B=1000$, Enigma M3's TFHE-shaped working set is gigabytes while clear-shape $N=1$ stays flat. Students designing a "just crank $B$" attack are designing a memory bomb. That is a reconfigurable-computing lesson, not an FHE lesson.

::: exercise
**Exercise 2.2**. Using only the boolean-path scale table in the HELUT README (epoch of this edition), plot tick time versus $B$ at $N=1$ and $N=1024$. Identify the regime where graph overhead dominates $N$, and the regime where $N=1024$ becomes memory-bound.

### What this chapter refuses to call a bitstream

A Metal graph executable is late-bound, cached, and device-specific. It is tempting to call it a bitstream. We do not, in this edition. A bitstream has a documented configuration memory; an `MPSGraphExecutable` has an Apple runtime. The analogy is useful in lecture and false on an exam. Chapter [2](#ch:metal){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:metal"} returns to this when the compiler stops unrolling schoolbook arithmetic into MLIR and starts calling ring kernels.

## Torus arithmetic and programmable bootstrapping {#ch:torus}

This chapter is a working minimum of TFHE [@chillotti2020tfhe; @ducas2015fhew], not a substitute for a lattice-crypto course. The goal is that a student can read a HELUT certificate line without bluffing.

### The torus and the native word

::: definition
**Definition 3.1** (Discrete torus used here). HELUT freezes the modulus $q=2^{32}$ and represents torus elements as `UInt32`. Addition is native wraparound. This is a *systems* choice: the machine word *is* the torus.
:::

That freeze answers a common question: $q=2^{32}$ is *not* a proof that lattice FHE requires a 32-bit modulus, and TensorLUT (**C19**) is already Boolean / $[0,1]$. Binary-modulus FHE is a new experiment, not a silent reread of **C4**--**C6**. Split: `directives/q-32-vs-q-2.md`.

The ring of polynomials is $$R_q = \mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^N+1),$$ the negacyclic ring. Multiplication by $X$ is a rotation with a sign flip on wrap-around---the algebraic fact that makes blind rotation a barrel shifter on coefficients.

::: warning
*Honesty note 3.2*. Exact $\mathrm{mod}\,2^{32}$ integer tensors are not "homomorphic encryption." They are the arithmetic. Encryption begins when those tensors are LWE or GLWE *samples* with a secret and noise.
:::

### LWE samples, in one page

::: definition
**Definition 3.2** (LWE sample [@regev2005lwe]). For secret $s\in\mathbb{Z}_q^n$, a sample is $(a,\langle a,s\rangle+e+m)\in\mathbb{Z}_q^n\times\mathbb{Z}_q$, with $a$ uniform and $e$ small Gaussian (or discrete) noise. GLWE is the polynomial analog: mask polynomials plus a body polynomial in $R_q$.
:::

HELUT's encrypted path uses LWE/GLWE samples and GGSW bootstrap keys. Decision-LWE is bound to IND-CPA by a machine-checkable certificate (**C5**); the bit estimate at production $(n,\sigma)=(1024,2^{16})$ is HELUT calibrated $175.7$ versus Sage Cost $180.2$ on that named row (**C23**) and is *not* "176-bit secure"---print **H1** with the number.

### Programmable bootstrapping, sketched

A TFHE Boolean gate is often evaluated by programmable bootstrapping (PBS): an encrypted phase selects a coefficient of a *test polynomial* via *blind rotation*, then a sample extract returns an LWE encryption of the LUT output.

Blind rotation is a product of CMUXes, one per bit of the encrypted phase. Each CMUX is an external product against a GGSW encrypt of a secret bit. The accumulator lives in $R_q$ (a GLWE). The sequential dependence across the $N$ (or $n$) bits is real: you cannot parallelize away the chain inside one bootstrap. You *can* refuse to unroll each external product into $O(N)$ host MLIR nodes. That refusal is Chapter [2](#ch:metal){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:metal"}.

### Negacyclic Toeplitz embedding

Let $A(X)=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}a_i X^i$. Negacyclic convolution against a vector $x$ is $M_A x$, where $M_A$ is the Toeplitz matrix whose first column is $(a_0,\ldots,a_{N-1})^\top$ and each subsequent column is the previous column rotated downward with the wrapped entry *negated* [@lyubashevsky2010ideal].

::: example
**Example 3.1** ($N=4$ by hand). Let $A=(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3)$. Then $$M_A
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_0 & -a_3 & -a_2 & -a_1 \\
a_1 &  a_0 & -a_3 & -a_2 \\
a_2 &  a_1 &  a_0 & -a_3 \\
a_3 &  a_2 &  a_1 &  a_0
\end{pmatrix}.$$ On `UInt32`, $-a\equiv 2^{32}-a$. The matrix product *is* the ring product. HELUT's Phase-1 kernel proved this bit-exact against a CPU schoolbook oracle, including torus corners $\{0,1,2^{31},2^{32}-1\}$.
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.1**. Expand $M_A$ for $A=(1,2,3,4)$ over $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}$ and multiply by $x=(1,0,0,0)^\top$. Interpret the output as a polynomial. Then multiply by $x=(0,1,0,0)^\top$ and explain the sign that appears.
:::

###### Why dense Toeplitz is not the FHE hot path.

Materializing $N\times N$ at $N=1024$ is $\Theta(N^2)$ words per LUT---a kernel proof and a memory stress, not a production PBS. The encrypted hot path moved through tiled schoolbook, fused external product, GPU-resident tiles, and 3-prime NTT (**C16**--**C18**). Students implementing "the HELUT paper kernel" as their FHE engine are implementing 2026-era Phase 1, which the compiler chapter treats as a *control-plane ancestor*.

### Message spacing and $Z_{2N}$

Blind rotation addresses coefficients at granularity $\delta = q/(2N)$. Packing several LWE bits into one phase must respect the cyclic group $Z_{2N}$, not an integer that merely looks like a power.

That closed hedge is the best homework in the chapter: a systems bug that is also an algebraic bug.

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.2**. Suppose $N=256$ so $2N=512$. A pack of three bits each scaled by $256$ can leave the $2N$ range. Show a numeric counterexample, then write the reduction that restores a valid rotation power.

# Pillar I --- Netlist-Clocked Torus FHE

## Netlist-clocked torus FHE {#ch:pillari}

Pillar I is the reason the course exists: a synthesized sequential circuit becomes one tensor graph, ticked by the host, with an encrypted backend that is actually LWE.

### The HELUT question

> *Can Apple Silicon's `MPSGraph` host exact torus modular arithmetic and gate-level sequential circuits---and can that same hardware object carry real bootstrapping keys without lying about it?*

The first half is a systems existence proof. The second half is a certificate problem. HELUT answers both, with the oracle path and the FHE path named as different objects [@helut-paper; @helut-release].

### Pipeline

::: center
:::

All FHE-path arithmetic tensors remain `MPSDataType.uInt32`. Float32 belongs to TensorLUT (Pillar II), not to this chapter.

### Compiler lowering

`YosysGraphCompiler` walks a `write_json` module:

1.  **Inputs.** Each input port bit becomes an `InputNode` placeholder of shape $[B,N]$.

2.  **State.** Each recognized flip-flop allocates a $Q$ placeholder *before* LUT lowering so sequential feedback nets resolve.

3.  **LUTs.** Cells schedule until all drivers exist; combinational cycles abort.

4.  **Next-state.** Enables and sync-resets become exact $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}$ muxes, e.g. active-high enable $$Q_{\mathrm{next}} = E\cdot D + (1-E)\cdot Q.$$

5.  **Outputs.** Driven nets bind to port tensors; Yosys `"x"` becomes constant 0.

Cell coverage includes `$_DFF*`, `$_DFFE*`, `$_SDFF*`, `$_SDFFE*`, `$_SDFFCE*`---the techmap PicoRV32 actually emits.

### Host clock

Each tick is one `graph.run`. With `retainHistory=false`, two preallocated state buffer sets ping-pong and output scratch is reused, so a 1 000-tick stress test does not leak `MTLBuffer` retention. Primary port feeds (including scripted `resetn`) are host-mutable shared buffers; LUT matrices or BK packs are uploaded once and cached.

This is the reconfigurable clock tree: not routed silicon, but a protocol with explicit buffer ownership.

### SING as the teaching metric {#sec:sing}

**SING** expands to **S**timuli **In**, **G**olden out.

In hardware verification, a *golden model* is the flawless reference circuit: feed test vectors (stimuli) in, expect the exact right bits out. For HELUT the golden model is the cleartext Yosys netlist simulator. A SING check (`--sing` / `--bench-encrypted-metrics`) is the primary teaching metric and the laboratory analogue of a scan chain: encrypt the same generic stimuli, evaluate under GGSW blind-rotate, decrypt, and demand bit-exact agreement with cleartext.

A passing encrypted tick under SING is not only a boolean match. The log is graded as a cryptographic bundle:

- **Functional:** ciphertext decrypts to the clear netlist (the hard gate).

- **Discrete:** $\infty$-norm inject lemmas hold where the path prints them.

- **Gaussian:** ingest failure probabilities stay under stated hypotheses.

- **Hardness:** calibrated classical bit estimates print with **H1** attached until the estimator row is honest.

- **Depth:** noisy bootstrap-key residuals are modeled or measured; default Track A throughput SING may still use $e{=}0$ BK (**H4**); covering noisy SING receipts are separate claims (**C28**, **C33**--**C37**, **C41**, **C43**, **C52**--**C54**).

Brutal engineering rule: if SING fails, you do not get to discuss milliseconds. Throughput and timing benches are irrelevant until the FHE path certifies its own correctness against the golden netlist.

:::

Inter-LUT refresh defaults to `publicMS` (lattice-compatible BK masks). `.secret` remains for coverage. `.none` is a debug foot-gun.

### Why PicoRV32 is real in FHE, with a speed qualifier

PicoRV32 lowers to 4 785 LUTs and 1 565 DFFs [@picorv32]. On the boolean-oracle path it compiles in ${\sim}1.3\,\mathrm{s}$ and ticks at ${\sim}173\,\mathrm{ms}$ ($N=1024$, $B=1$) in the 2026-08-12 boolean bench (**C1**). That is a fabric existence proof: a commodity neural/GPU graph can host a soft CPU's *shape*.

The encrypted path uses the same host-clocked sequential seam as the toy counter (**C38**) and toy ISA (**C40**). Claim **C45** is one encrypted host posedge of the full PicoRV32 netlist at demo $N{=}8$ (output SING). Claim **C46** is the PRD 10-tick scripted `resetn` boot at the same $N$: CPU public-ms boolean SING PASS in $0.972\,\mathrm{s}$ ($97.20\,\mathrm{ms}$/row), calibrated hardness $4.0$ bits, with decrypted $Q$ matching the clear register file. A second public-MS on already-native $D$ for plain `$_DFF_P_` cells had been silently folding $1\to 0$ --- outputs could still match. Claim **C49** is execute+store: `addi x1,x0,1` then `sw`, `wdata`=1, $3.79\,\mathrm{s}/48$ ($78.90\,\mathrm{ms}$/row). Claim **C50** is load-back: `lw` sees stored 1 on the NBA xfer, $3.77\,\mathrm{s}/48$ ($78.53\,\mathrm{ms}$/row). Claim **C51** is the first Metal sequential PicoRV receipt: NOP-fetch, two instruction addresses, tiled BR, $7.94\,\mathrm{s}$/row at demo $N$. Metal $N{=}1024$ is not SING-logged this epoch --- the LUT-tax is the remaining engineering, not a missing compiler.

::: warning
*Honesty note 1.1*. "We executed encrypted RISC-V" means **C50** on CPU (addi/store/load of 1) and **C51** on Metal only as a NOP-fetch at demo $N$ ($\sim 8\,\mathrm{s}$/row). Not Linux; not Metal $N{=}1024$. Avenue 2 in Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"} is self-modifying dark code, not this receipt.

### Threat / fidelity split

  Out of scope unless measured   Side channels; quantum; estimator Cost as "secure bits" on every row (**H1**); native $k{=}1$ / `cryptoPublicMS` noisy BK and PicoRV covering at $N{=}1024$ (**H4** remainder; Grade B is **C52**--**C54**; PicoRV covering-b2 is **C60** FAIL).
  ------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

The split is intentional. If the tensor datapath cannot boot a CPU under mock encodings, adding real TFHE noise only makes the systems problem harder. If the FHE path cannot SING an adder, a CPU slide is theatre.

### The picture that changed the compiler

    Yosys $lut  -->  pack LWE  -->  blind rotate (N CMUXes)
                                     |
                                     +-- failure: each external product expands
                                     |    sum_j b_j * X^j a  as O(N) MPSGraph ops
                                     |    --> millions of host MLIR nodes
                                     |    --> encode wall >> run wall
                                     |
                                     +-- design: small graph that *calls* ring kernels
                                         encode cheap; run on Metal; cache

CMUX dependence across bootstrap bits is sequential and real. The pain was never "CMUX cannot run on a GPU." The pain was *encoding a schoolbook expansion that should never have been a graph* [@helut-metal].

### Doctrine

SoftBus / ANE remains a graph machine. We stop mistaking "unroll all ring math into MLIR" for "use the GPU." `MPSGraph` is a *staged IR* and a *scheduler*. Polynomial multiplication and the external product are first-class GPU operations.

Why this GPU first: the laboratory was an M-series Mac pushed to extremes so the $\lambda$-squeeze could run at all (`directives/why-apple-silicon.md`). That does not freeze the math to Apple.

### Phase 1 --- survive $N=1024$

Phase 1 does not change the cryptography. It changes the control plane.

::: center

  Tiled blind rotate   CMUX windows of width $W$; re-ingest ACC    Encode cost scales with $W$, not fused $N\times$ schoolbook.
  Constant CSE         Shared splat banks per tile                 Graph builders die on `constantWithScalar` spam.
  Executable cache     Compile once per $(N,\ell,W,\mathrm{BK})$   Trial 1 is cold; ticks $\ge 2$ must hit cache.
  Telemetry            `encode` / `gpu_run` / `host_repack`        Silence is not a hang if the log counts tiles.
:::

Phase 1 without Phase 2 still leaves $O(W\cdot N)$ encode inside each tile. Phase 2 without Phase 1 is a kernel drop into an unmeasured fused path. The laboratory did both, in that order.

### Phase 2 --- ring kernels

1.  **Negacyclic poly-mul** as a Metal kernel, bit-identical to CPU schoolbook (**C18** NTT $\equiv$ schoolbook, 19 tests).

2.  **Fused external product** (**C16**): one `helut_ggsw_external_product` launch per CMUX. $N=1024$ microbench $1.043\,\mathrm{s}$/BR.

3.  **GPU-resident BR tile** (**C17**): ACC $+$ BK on device; $0.519\,\mathrm{s}$/BR at $N=1024$; $N=64$ at $0.001\,\mathrm{s}$/BR.

4.  **3-prime NTT persist tile** (**C18**): gadget digits in-tile; BK in NTT domain; pointwise EP $+$ iNTT $+$ CRT. $0.433\,\mathrm{s}$/BR at $N=1024$ (gpu $0.43\,\mathrm{s}$, RSS $148\,\mathrm{MiB}$).

Default Metal BR: fused if $N\le 64$, tiled-kernel otherwise (NTT EP inside tiles). Legacy fused megagraph is `--metal-br-fused` only, and at production $N$ it is a museum exhibit.

Phase 1 makes encoding *finish*. Phase 2 makes encoding *irrelevant*. Together they are a graph-native torus compiler: staged IR $+$ ring kernels $+$ cached executables---instead of a schoolbook megagraph hoping the GPU will eventually appear. (SoftBus is Pillar III's cipher contract, not this Metal lowering.)

## Certificates as first-class artifacts {#ch:certs}

Most compiler courses grade a binary that runs. This course grades a binary that *refuses* when it cannot certify.

### The surface

::: center
  Certificate                                           Role

`TFHENoise.refuse` if no certificate. That is not an API flourish. It is the difference between a demo and a claim.

### How to read a SING log

**SING** $=$ **S**timuli **In**, **G**olden out (Section [1.5](#sec:sing){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:sing"}): encrypted evaluation must match the cleartext netlist on the same generic vectors. A passing encrypted tick is then read as a bundle:

- Functional: ciphertext decrypts to the clear netlist (the SING gate).

- Discrete: $\infty$-norm lemmas held on the inject.

- Gaussian: ingest $\varepsilon$ under the stated hypotheses.

- Hardness: calibrated classical bits, with **H1** attached (**C23** filled the estimator JSON; four anchors still $|\Delta|>16$).

- Depth: noisy-BK model; **C22** measured at covering gadget; **C26** graded fail at `cryptoPublicMS` $N{=}1024$; covering Track A torus-scale is **C52**--**C54**; native $k{=}1$ remains **C37**/**C55**; `cryptoPublicMS` noisy SING remains **C26**/**C56**.

A lab report on this material is incomplete if it stops at milliseconds: the certificate lines are the result, and the timing is context for it.

::: {#thm:covering .theorem}
**Theorem 3.1** (Exact public-MS covering degrees; corpus Theorem 3). *Let the torus word be $q=2^{32}$ and let a public modulus-switch gadget have $g_0=\delta$. If the gadget covers, then $(1+\log_2 N)$ divides $32$. Consequently, among $N\in\{8,16,\dots,2048\}$ the only exact covering degrees are $N=8$ and $N=128$.*
:::

###### Proof (machine-checked).

`GGSWPublicMSCovering.certificate()` asserts the divisibility lemma and enumerates `exactDegrees` $=[8,128]$ over the practical range; the test additionally pins $\mathrm{baseLog}\cdot\ell=22$ for $N{=}1024$.

$q=2^{32}$, binary secret, native Sage 10.9 $+$ lattice-estimator (**C23**). Merge tolerance is $16$ bits: four rows pass, four fail.

### Five-cell test, applied to certificates

Certificates are themselves claims. They need the five cells:

1.  Proof: the lemma in code (`TFHENoiseProof`, ...).

2.  Table: the calibration table; the cookbook production row.

3.  Metric: $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$; bit estimates; $B_{\mathrm{bk}}$.

4.  Examples: demo $N=8$ (honest fail of 128-bit) and production $N=1024$.

5.  Application: refuse-closed encrypt so a netlist tick cannot silently drop hardness.

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.1**. **C52** closed covering Track A noisy BK at $N{=}1024$ ($\sigma{=}128$, $k{=}7$). Name the two remainders of **H4** that are still graded negatives, and the two follow-up rows that mapped them without closing $\varepsilon$ or SING (**C37**/**C55**, **C26**/**C56**). PicoRV covering at production $N$ is the third remainder; it is a LUT-tax, not a missing SING log at demo $N$.
:::

### Honesty as an engineering interface

The non-claims of Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"} are not ethics theater. They are API documentation for speech:

- Oracle Metal graphs expose the *shape* of encrypted evaluation (batch, $N$, clock). They do not expose Decision-LWE.

- `publicMS` is an on-lattice refresh intent. It is not a leakage proof (**N** on side channels).

- A campaign's settings/second is a cleartext Metal number. It does not certify encrypted tick rate.

::: lab
**Laboratory 3.1** (Certificate literacy). Run `.build/release/helut --hardness-table` and classify each printed row as demo, weak, or production-shaped. For each row, write one sentence a journalist may print and one sentence they may not.
:::

### Why $\varepsilon$ needs a sample size {#sec:eps-samples}

The failure probability $\varepsilon$ that appears on a noise certificate is not sampled. It is an analytic Gaussian tail evaluated at a *measured* standard deviation: $$\varepsilon = \Pr\bigl[\,|Z| \ge \delta/2\,\bigr],
  \qquad Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\hat\sigma^2),
  \qquad
  \log_2\varepsilon \;\approx\; -\frac{(\delta/2)^2}{2\hat\sigma^2\ln 2}.$$

Read the exponent carefully: $\log_2\varepsilon \propto -1/\hat\sigma^2$. Differentiating, a relative error $r$ in $\hat\sigma$ moves $\log_2\varepsilon$ by about $2\,\lvert\log_2\varepsilon\rvert\, r$. At $\lvert\log_2\varepsilon\rvert=65$ a one percent error in $\hat\sigma$ is worth $1.3$ orders.

And $\hat\sigma$ is an RMS over however many residuals were collected --- one per trial. The standard error of a standard-deviation estimate from $m$ samples is about $1/\sqrt{2m}$, so:

::: warning
*Honesty note 3.1*. A measured $\varepsilon$ of $-65.4$ against a $2^{-64}$ bar, taken at four samples, carries roughly $\pm 46$ orders. It does not clear the bar. It does not fail to clear the bar. It says nothing about the bar at all. Quote the confidence bound, or quote nothing.
:::

The bound is standard: $m\hat\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim \chi^2(m)$, so a one-sided upper bound on $\sigma$ is $\hat\sigma\sqrt{m/\chi^2_{\alpha}(m)}$, and $\varepsilon$ evaluated there is the conservative figure --- the only one worth comparing against a target. HELUT prints it:

    cryptoPublicMS B=64: ... eps log2=-23.5

::: warning
*Honesty note 3.2* (Sample cost can make a bar unreachable). The same measurement at production degree costs about $155\,\mathrm{s}$ per trial ($N{=}1024$, covering-b1, $\ell{=}32$). The $n\approx 8450$ needed for $\pm 1$ order is therefore roughly *fifteen days*. Some bars cannot be established by running the experiment longer, and saying so is part of the certificate.

# Pillar II --- Differentiable Hardware

## Continuous hardware, discrete silicon {#ch:pillarii}

The structural theorem of this chapter is corpus-safe (**C19**) --- not a finished lecture. A plain-English restatement lives in `directives/theorem-1-plain.md`; a Swift-free check is `python3 Scripts/tensorlut_math_ref.py`, and the smallest worked example of the LUT view is `python3 Scripts/toy_cipher_demo.py` (`INTRO.md`). The separable melt--freeze--snap certificate is corpus-safe (**C44**). Shatter / hold grades and campaign empirics remain seminar-depth and are *not* the theorem [@helut-tensorlut-thm].

### The problem boolean search cannot see

A combinatoric sieve on a cipher netlist proposes discrete genotypes: INIT bits, plugboard pairs, rotor orders. On a short ciphertext the search space is both enormous and full of linguistic hallucinations (the P1030680 campaign is the case study, not the claim). Boolean search *rejects*. It does not *propose* a nearby reciprocal structure that is almost a stecker.

Pillar II melts the hardware [@helut-paper; @helut-tensorlut-thm].

### Setup

Let $L$ be the number of LUT6 cells and $w\in[0,1]^{64L}$ the concatenated INIT genome. Let $y(w)$ be the *multilinear extension* of those INITs on $[0,1]$ (exact on $\{0,1\}$ inputs). Let $t$ be a target bit vector of matching width. Soft crypto fitness and discreteness penalty: $$\begin{align}
  F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)
  &= -\lVert y(w)-t\rVert_2^2, \\
  \pi(w)
  &= \sum_i w_i(1-w_i), \\
  F(w)
  &= F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)-\lambda\,\pi(w),
  \qquad \lambda\ge 0.
\end{align}$$

::: remark
*Remark 1.1* (Implementation schedule). HELUT's GA uses a squeeze $\lambda=\lambda_{\max}(p')^2$. Theorem 1 needs only $\lambda\ge 0$.
:::

Emitter: $E(w)_i=\mathbf{1}[w_i\ge\tfrac12]$. Freeze mask $M\subseteq\{1,\dots,64L\}$ removes frozen coordinates from $\pi$. Stecker genotypes are *partial involutions* (disjoint pairs) on $\{0,\dots,25\}$.

Every Yosys `$lut` of width $1\ldots 6$ pads to a 64-wide `Float32` INIT. The forward pass is branchless and GPU-shaped. It is not torus FHE.

### Theorem 1 (structural) {#sec:thm-tensorlut}

::: {#thm:tensorlut .theorem}
**Theorem 1.1** (TensorLUT continuous$\to$discrete; corpus Theorem 1). *Assume the hypotheses on the certificate: the LUT is multilinear; the GA mutates only unfrozen $w_i\in[0,1]$; the involution sandwich freezes core INITs. Then:*

1.  ***Discreteness.** $\pi(w)\ge 0$, with equality iff $w\in\{0,1\}^{64L}$.*

2.  ***Crypto MSE.** $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)\le 0$, with equality iff $y(w)=t$.*

3.  ***Combined objective.** $F(w)\le F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)$; if $\pi(w)>0$, increasing $\lambda$ strictly decreases $F$.*

4.  ***Emitter.** $E$ is idempotent on $\{0,1\}^{64L}$ and agrees with threshold $\tfrac12$.*

5.  ***Involution sandwich.** Overlapping pairs are rejected; applying a valid pair-set twice is the identity on the alphabet.*

6.  ***Freeze.** Coordinates in $M$ do not contribute to $\pi$.*

For each lemma, write one sentence a journalist may print and one they may not.
:::

### Shatter versus hold (empirical)

A full cold-start on a large sequential cipher discovers continuous shortcuts that *shatter* when $\lambda$ rises: $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}$ looks perfect in float and dies on the Boolean cube. Targeted melting freezes known-good LUT blocks (`freezeMask`) and evolves only the unknown cone---clause 6 of Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} is why frozen coordinates do not pay $\pi$. Early resignation reboots doomed lineages rather than squeezing a reciprocal shortcut to the end.

::: definition
**Definition 1.1** (Grade). Under a published $\lambda$ schedule, a lineage **holds** if the emitted binary netlist preserves $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}=0$ (or a stated bar). It **shatters** if discreteness kills the continuous solution. Both grades are science. Shatter is not a failed demo; it is evidence about shortcuts. It is *not* a clause of Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"}.
:::

### Involution sandwich

Stecker genotypes are partial involutions (disjoint pairs) by construction (Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"}, clause 5). The GA cannot propose a non-reciprocal map. The 16 cone LUTs around an identity plugboard cannot invent letter swaps by INIT melt; the sandwich injects $S(\mathrm{CT})$ into a frozen core and scores soft PT against bits of $S(P)$. Reciprocity is structural.

::: warning
*Honesty note 1.2*. Short cribs leave unused pairs unconstrained and can admit false $F=0$ steckers. Grade active-map agreement on $\mathrm{CT}\cup\mathrm{PT}$, use parsimony, grow the pair budget on plateau, and allow soft freeze $+$ thaw. TensorLUT grades are not a campaign decrypt (**N**, **H6**).
:::

### Adversarial synthesis as a compiler loop

Forward: silicon $\to$ uniform float tensors. Reverse: cooled tensors $\to$ INIT hex $\to$ Verilog LUT instantiations. The loop is a generative compiler in *this* laboratory: cooled tensors emit LUT6 Verilog, not a bitstream onto a physical FPGA. Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} is the invariant the loop is forced to obey. It is not a guarantee that the loop finds a key.

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.2**. Why must $\pi(w)=\sum w_i(1-w_i)$ vanish on binary INITs, and why is a fitness that ignores $\pi$ allowed to "solve" a cipher that no FPGA can implement? Give a two-LUT numerical cartoon. Which clause of Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} did you just unpack?
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.3** (Seminar). Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} is structural, not complete. Write the statement of a completeness theorem you wish were true (melt recovers $X$ on netlist class $Y$ under schedule $Z$), and the counterexample shape you would try first. Do not upgrade shatter/hold grades into that theorem.

# Pillar III --- Adversarial Polymorphic Ciphers

## Ciphers that grow under fire {#ch:pillariii}

### Evidence boundary for a design laboratory

Historical Enigma traits motivate the E256 design laboratory, but the checked claims here do not prove those traits universally fatal or prove their removal for every generated machine. This collecting surface records three existing rows: bounded fixture-v4 implementation parity (C10), a bounded structural certificate / protocol (C24), and a historical encrypted teaching cone (C39).

The same-state reciprocal shape is a design target. The evidence below is finite: only checks explicitly called exhaustive are exhaustive, and key/state coverage remains bounded.

### Fixture-v4 evidence capsule (scaffold)

- The fixed live profile is schema-4 `E256-v2/gen0`, fixture-v4.

- Its conjugated-XOR center is $A_i^{-1}(A_i(x)\oplus k_i)$.

- The host derives and transports `(payload, centerMask, absoluteByteCounter)`; RTL validates `absoluteByteCounter` and does not implement HMAC.

- The formal C24 test is **1/1 PASS**; the full E256 C10 suite is **49/49 PASS**. The receipt is `logs/e256-v2-gen0-fixture-v4-validation.json`.

::: warning
*Honesty note 1.3*. Theorem 2 records a *bounded structural certificate / protocol*, not a universal proof. Finite checks are exhaustive only where stated, and state/key coverage is bounded. It is not IND-CPA, an HMAC proof, external cryptanalysis, human acceptance, or a finished polymorphic-cipher standard.
:::

### Red-pressure questions kept separate

TensorLUT, known-plaintext, and `ent` experiments remain internal Red questions on this collecting surface. C24 does not show that those experiments cannot force a generation roll, and the fixture-v4 receipt is not external cryptanalysis or human acceptance. No coupled-NLFF hardening result is part of the bounded certificate.

### Draft lab prompts (scaffold; not lecture-ready)

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.4** (Blue studio prompt). Propose one additional E256 invariant as an open design question (for example, an NLFF period lower bound or BRAM burst-width condition). Specify a test that could refuse a generation, but do not promote the proposal to a claim without a checked receipt.
:::

::: exercise

### Relation to Pillars I and II

This collecting surface links the bounded C24 protocol to its fixture receipt (Theorem [1.4](#thm:enigma256){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:enigma256"}). **C39** is a historical frozen one-round legacy-UKW scramble under GGSW Metal SING. It predates live fixture-v4 and does not exercise transported `centerMask`/`absoluteByteCounter`, the conjugated-XOR center, live BRAM, NLFF, or a full core. Calling that lab "production encrypted E256" is a **N**.

# Laboratory, Applications, and the Frontier

## Application gallery {#ch:apps}

Applications exist to keep pillars honest. A compiler with no netlist is a speech; a melt with no cipher is a float toy; a polymorphic cipher with no Red is a blog post.

Canonical nine-slot card: `directives/application-gallery.md`.

### Pillar I (encrypted)

1.  **Encrypted `full_adder` SING.** Multi-LUT correctness at production-shaped $N$ (**C6**, **C20**; **C21** is $e{=}0$ BK). Covering noisy adder is **C52**.

2.  **Encrypted tree / regex SING.** Compiler is not adder-specialized (**C6** demo $N$; regex covering **C57** at production $N$). Tree Metal covering remains.

3.  **Hardness $+$ noisy-BK certificates.** Estimator fill-in and covering-gadget residuals (**C5**, **C22**, **C23**). Covering Track A at $N{=}1024$, $\sigma{=}128$, $k{=}7$ is **C52**--**C54**; cheaper covering-b2 is **C57**. Product-shaped `cryptoPublicMS` inject remains a graded failure (**C26**, **C56**); native $k{=}1$ remains **C37**/**C55** (**H4** remainder).

4.  **Encrypted sequential.** Counter (**C38**), toy `NOP`/`ADD` (**C40**), PicoRV32 `addi`+`sw`+`lw` at demo $N{=}8$ (**C50**); Metal NOP-fetch (**C51**).

5.  **4-bit CSA vs ripple LUT cut** (**C42**). Architecture, not TensorLUT melt.

### Pillar I shape laboratory (oracle --- not FHE)

1.  **Decision tree.** A 4-bit non-linear boundary, 7 LUTs. Exact threshold logic on a batch of records. Teaches: non-linear Boolean $\neq$ neural net, and $B$ is a capacity knob.

2.  **Regex / DFA search.** 3-character matcher, 23 LUTs. Large $B$ turns unified memory into the story.

3.  **PicoRV32.** ${\sim}4.8\mathrm{k}$ LUTs, ${\sim}1.5\mathrm{k}$ DFFs. Scripted `resetn` boot. Oracle path: **C1**. Encrypted 1-tick at demo $N{=}8$: **C50** `lw` sees 1; Metal NOP-fetch **C51**.

### Pillar II

1.  **M4 TensorLUT baseline emit** (**C8**).

2.  **Stecker involution sandwich / formal** (**C9**, **C19**, **C25**, **C44**, **C48**).

3.  **Shatter vs hold under $\lambda$** --- seminar empirics; not a decrypt (**H6**).

### Pillar III

1.  **SoftBus reciprocity / bijection** (**C10**, **C24**).

2.  **Encrypted 1-round frozen scramble** (**C39**) --- algebraic slice under torus FHE, not live BRAM.

3.  **Red battery** (TensorLUT / KPA / `ent`) --- empirical grades in `logs/enigma256-*`.

4.  **Fail-closed NLFF harden** (**C24** clause 5).

### Campaign as a case study (not a decrypt)

Welchman-path break of known P1030684 (**C2**), $\le 10$-plug SAT kill chain (**C3**), Potsdam/Plaice $\neq$ P1030680 (**C11**), windowed discriminator versus whole-message turnover (**C12**): these belong in a cryptanalysis seminar attached to Pillar II methods.

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.6**. Pick one application tier and write a five-cell card for it. If you cannot name two runnable instances, it is not ready for the gallery lecture.

## Laboratories {#ch:lab}

Systems-track labs assume macOS 14$+$, Apple Silicon, Swift 6.3, and a release `helut` at repo root: `swift build -c release --product helut`. Theory-track substitutes are stated per lab.

### Lab 0 --- Claim literacy (everyone)

Read `directives/claim-sheet.md` at the printed epoch. Classify five public sentences (instructor-provided) as **C**, **H**, **N**, or frontier. No machine required.

### Lab 1 --- Negacyclic oracle

Implement $N=8$ schoolbook mul in $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N+1)$ and check a dense Toeplitz expansion against it on torus corners. Theory track: $N=4$ by hand (Chapter [3](#ch:torus){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:torus"} exercises).

### Lab 2 --- Netlist clock

Compile the checked-in `counter` or `full_adder` Yosys JSON from `Generated/` with `--compile-only`. If you re-synthesize an authored source from `Hardware/`, write the disposable JSON below `build/hardware/`; do not overwrite a root compatibility file. Tick with `--bench`. Identify $B$, $N$, LUT count, DFF count. Explain in writing why $N$ is not the circuit size.

### Lab 3 --- Boolean oracle versus FHE path

    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 64 \
      --lut-backend pbs --encoding phase --bench-equiv
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/counter_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/toy_isa_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 32
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/PicoRV32/picorv32_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --ticks 48 --reset-hold 3 \
      --encrypted-mem prog --paths 'blind-rotate public-ms boolean'

Deliverable: a table with columns {backend, $N$, SING, certificates printed, may we say "encrypted" on a slide?}.

### Lab 4 --- Production-shaped SING

Follow Appendix [4](#app:repro){reference-type="ref" reference="app:repro"}. Record ms/row at $N=8$ and $N=1024$. Write the **H1** asterisk next to hardness. Write the **H4** asterisk next to depth: covering Track A Grade B is **C52**--**C54**; $e{=}0$ BK is still the default noiseless SING; native $k{=}1$ / `cryptoPublicMS` / PicoRV covering remain.

Theory track: parse a published SING log and reconstruct the table without running Metal.

### Lab 4b --- Measured noisy BK (**C22**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 8 \
      --trials 8 --bk-noise 64

Deliverable: $B_{\mathrm{bk}}$, $\hat\sigma$, $\delta/2$, and one sentence on why $\ell=1$ `booleanPublicMS` is omitted. Theory track: read `logs/helut-noisy-bk-measure.log`. Optional: parse a **C52** covering log at $N{=}1024$ and name the three **H4** remainders (**C37**/**C55**, **C26**/**C56**, PicoRV covering).

### Lab 5 --- Metal compiler post-mortem

Compare fused-megagraph DNF, **C16**--**C21** using Chapter [2](#ch:metal){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:metal"}'s table. Optional systems: `make test-metal-p1` and one `--bench-encrypted-micro --degree 64` run. Deliverable: the **H3** paragraph in your own words (scheduler vs NTT).

### Lab 6 --- TensorLUT Theorem 1 (**C19**)

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTFormalCertificate

Deliverable: name the six lemmas, the certificate hypotheses, and one sentence that Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} does *not* prove. Optional: `testTensorLUTMeltFreezeSnapCertificate` (**C44**) --- what class of INIT genomes the unique-maximizer lemma covers. Theory track, no Swift and no Mac: `python3 Scripts/toy_cipher_demo.py` for the smallest worked example, then `python3 Scripts/tensorlut_math_ref.py`; read `directives/theorem-1-plain.md` and `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md`; reconstruct the five-cell card. Both scripts are executable checks, not machine-checked proofs.

### Lab 7 --- Five-cell audit (everyone)

The signature assignment (Chapter [2](#ch:instructor){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:instructor"}). One abstract sentence from `paper/helut.tex`; five cells; a pass/fail on whether the sentence is lecture-safe at this epoch.

### Lab 8 --- Frontier proposal (everyone)

Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}: pick one avenue. Propose the first experiment that would mint a **C** row. You may not claim the avenue works.

### Lab 9 --- Run it five times {#sec:lab-repeat}

Every measurement in this corpus began as a single observation. This lab is about what that costs, and it needs no Apple hardware for the first half.

1.  Pick any timing in `directives/claim-sheet.md`. Re-run it five times with `Scripts/bench_repeat.py` and report min, median, max and relative spread. Was the archived figure a median, or a best case?

2.  Run the same command once on a cold cache and once warm. On the machine these claims were measured, one row moved by $2.4\times$ between the two. Which of the two numbers belongs in a paper?

3.  Now take a row whose claim is a *failure*. Run it five times. Report whether the failure is deterministic. A negative that reproduces three times in five is a different scientific object from one that reproduces five times in five --- name the difference in one sentence.

4.  Read `logs/leeloo/prefix-vs-postfix.md`. Two rows changed stability after a one-line source fix. Explain why running each row once could never have found that, no matter how carefully the code was reviewed.

Deliverable: a table of {row, archived figure, median of 5, spread, verdict} and one paragraph on which archived numbers you would now decline to quote.

::: warning
*Honesty note 2.1*. The harness refuses to start if another benchmark is already running, and that refusal is load-bearing rather than fussy: one benchmark on a sixteen-core machine is about $26\%$ per core, well under any sane load threshold, yet it contends for the GPU and memory bandwidth and will skew every number in a concurrent sweep. A build is worse --- it replaces the binary underneath a running sweep.

### Optional project slots

TensorLUT involution sandwich replay (**C9** logs), E256 invariant studio, or a new Yosys netlist (student RTL $\to$ SING). Instructor approval required; campaign decrypt projects are out of scope.

## Open problems (trajectory) {#ch:open}

This chapter is the discovery path after disclosure [@helut-trajectory]. None of these items are lecture facts until they have receipts.

### Mid-term pillars

1.  **Pillar I science:** shallower nets, NTT/persist graphs, estimator-backed params (this book's Parts III).

2.  **Pillar II science:** Theorem 1 landed (**C19**); corollary emitter / freeze (**C25**); melt--freeze--snap on a separable interpolant (**C44**); 2-LUT cascade emit (**C48**); remaining: multi-LUT topological melt, stream-cipher melts.

3.  **Pillar III science:** SoftBus Theorem 2 landed (**C24**, Chapter [1](#ch:pillariii){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillariii"}); remaining: polymorphic Red/Blue standard beyond E256 SoftBus.

4.  **FHE gate / ZK depth:** TensorLUT aimed at multiplicative depth (queued; not a part of this edition).

5.  **Side-channel (parked):** bgpucap-style power on live Metal graphs only with controlled fixtures --- Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}, avenue 5.

**Exercise 3.1** (Pick a next experiment). Choose one open hedge. Write a one-page lab proposal: command line, pass bar, which box in this book would change, and which **N** you refuse to imply if the experiment fails.

## Frontier (not claims) {#ch:frontier}

The text in this chapter is adapted from the project's speculative avenues [@helut-avenues]. It is included so the public story stays honest: **reproducible core now; weird frontier labeled as frontier.**

Instructors: last two seminars, or a 10% essay. Never a true/false bank.

### Encrypted LLM guardrails

First graduating experiment (suggested): a 4-LUT encrypted classifier SING on synthetic token bits, with a certificate, *before* any talk of genetic mutation or Ollama.

### Self-modifying encrypted binaries

First graduating experiment: encrypted instruction-fetch SING on a toy ISA smaller than PicoRV32, with a written ethics note. This is a privacy architecture problem, not a malware homework.

### Honey-token ledgers

First graduating experiment: regex netlist SING at modest $B$ with an explicit non-claim that the node learns nothing---then measure what the *host process* still sees (lengths, timings). Honesty before mesh networks.

### Genetic hardware synthesis

First graduating experiment: one offline generation of a 2-LUT netlist that SING-matches a fixed spec, wall-clock of synth$+$lower, no on-the-fly claims.

### Metal-tick power analysis (parked)

First graduating experiment: fixture harness that emits tick markers and a published "no analysis yet" log. Do not assign attacks against third-party graphs.

### Rules for frontier essays

1.  Label every paragraph frontier or first-experiment.

2.  Name the **C** row it would become, and the **N** it must not imply on the way.

3.  Cite Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"}. If the five cells cannot even be *imagined*, the essay is not ready.

### Standing non-implications

These were an unnumbered list until 2026-08-15. They are now **N** rows in the claim sheet, because the campaign report and the agent rules cite **N5**, **N6** and **N7** by number and those references had no resolvable target. Numbering follows the original clause order, so existing citations keep their meaning.

Final: take-home claim audit plus a short oral defense of one reproduced box and one hedge box.

The thing being assessed is whether a hedge survives contact with a question. Stating **H1** and then, under follow-up, sliding into "so it is 176-bit secure" is the characteristic failure mode, and noticing it in your own sentence is the skill the course is trying to build. Treat it as the main rubric line and as something to discuss in the viva --- not as an automatic fail. Everyone does it once; the difference between a student who has learned the material and one who has not is whether they catch themselves.

## Reproduce commands (course subset) {#app:repro}

Canonical file: `REPRODUCE.md`. Cookbook: `directives/parameter-cookbook.md`. Build:

    swift build -c release --product helut
    make hardware-check   # ownership + root compatibility integrity

Authored HDL is canonical under `Hardware/`; checked-in generated receipts are under `Generated/`; disposable regeneration belongs under `build/hardware/`. Root HDL and netlist names are compatibility entry points, not generation destinations.

### Hardness (**C23**, **H1**)

    .build/release/helut --hardness-table
    ./Scripts/helut_sage_estimate.sh

Native SageMath 10.9 at `~/Applications/SageMath-10-9.app`. Production row: HELUT $175.7$ vs estimator $180.2$. Four of eight anchors exceed the 16-bit merge tolerance --- do not quote $176$ as estimator cost on every row.

### Encrypted SING (**C4**--**C6**, **C38**--**C40**)

    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    ./Scripts/helut_encrypted_sing.sh
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/counter_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Enigma256/e256_round1_netlist.json --degree 16 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 32
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/toy_isa_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 32

**C38** counter, **C39** frozen E256 round (LUT4, $N\ge 16$), **C40** toy ISA. None of these is PicoRV32 or live BRAM SoftBus.

### Metal microbench and NTT (**C18**)

    make test-metal-p1
    .build/release/helut --bench-encrypted-micro --degree 1024 \
      --trials 2 --warmup 1

Default at $N>64$ is tiled-kernel with inlined NTT. Do not assign `--metal-br-fused` at $N=1024$ as a timed lab.

### Wavefront SING (**C20**, **C21**)

Boolean $10.6\,\mathrm{s}/8$; crypto $\ell=2$ $11.38\,\mathrm{s}/8$ at $N=1024$. Logs already in `logs/` --- students need not re-time Metal unless the instructor assigns a machine-local check.

    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 8 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal public-ms boolean'
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 8 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal public-ms crypto'

### Measured noisy BK (**C22**)

Covering gadget only. $\ell=1$ `booleanPublicMS` cannot carry BK noise.

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 8 \
      --trials 8 --bk-noise 64
    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 128 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 64

### Product-shaped $N{=}1024$ residual (**C26**)

Graded negative for `cryptoPublicMS` at $N{=}1024$ (**H4** remainder; Grade B covering Track A is **C52**--**C54**). Expect undecodable inject $B{=}64$; $B{=}4$ on `.crypto` may pass $\infty$-norm with $\varepsilon\log_2\approx -1$ (not $-64$). **C56**: $k{=}7$ does not make Metal public-ms SING pass.

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 2 --bk-noise 64
    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 2 --bk-noise 4

### Exact public-MS covering (**C27**)

    swift test -c release --filter testGGSWPublicMSCoveringCertificate

Exact degrees among $\{8,\ldots,2048\}$: $\{8,128\}$ only --- for any power-of-two word $w$ (**C29**), not just $q{=}2^{32}$. Statement: `directives/ggsw-public-ms-covering.md`.

### Track B $\varepsilon$ vs inject $B$ (**C30**)

    for B in 1 2 4 8 16 32 64; do
      .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 128 \
        --trials 8 --bk-noise $B
    done

Residual amplification stays large; printed $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-24$ only at $B{=}64$.

### Incomplete public-MS gap / Track A approx (**C31**/**C32**)

    swift test -c release --filter testGGSWIncompleteCoveringCertificate
    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 1

uncoveredBits$(1024)=10$. `.crypto` $B{=}1$ $\Rightarrow\varepsilon\log_2\approx-8.4$ (8 trials). Statement: `directives/ggsw-incomplete-covering.md`.

### Track A Metal covering-crypto SING (**C33**)

    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 1 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal secret crypto'
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 1 \
      --paths covering-crypto

Expect PASS; covering `.crypto`, not `cryptoPublicMS`.

### Track A covering-b4 $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$ (**C34**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 8 --bk-noise 1 --covering-base-log 4
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 1 \
      --paths covering-b4

Expect $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-913$; Metal PASS. Torus-scale $B{=}128$ still fails.

### Track A covering-b2 $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$ through $B{=}16$ (**C35**)

    .build/release/helut-bench --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 16 --covering-base-log 2
    .build/release/helut-bench --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 16 \
      --paths covering-b2

Expect $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-65.4$ at $B{=}16$; Metal PASS. $B{=}32$ fails the bar.

### Track A covering-b1 $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$ through $B{=}32$ (**C36**)

    .build/release/helut-bench --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 32 --covering-base-log 1
    .build/release/helut-bench --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 32 \
      --paths covering-b1

Expect $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-139$ at $B{=}32$; Metal PASS. $B{=}128$ still fails.

### Track A $\sigma{=}128$ covering-b1 at $N\le 512$ (**C41**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 512 --trials 4 \
      --bk-noise-sigma 128 --covering-base-log 1
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 512 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths covering-b1

Does not close $N{=}1024$ at native $k{=}1$. Headroom is $\delta=q/(2N)$.

### $k\delta$ encoding at $N{=}1024$ (**C43**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 --trials 4 \
      --bk-noise-sigma 128 --covering-base-log 1 --boolean-scale-mul 4
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths covering-b1 --boolean-scale-mul 4

$k{=}4$ Metal SING PASS; 4-trial $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-43$ (not $-64$). $k{=}8$ meets $\varepsilon$; public-ms SING fails under $/k\delta$ refresh.

### Stride-$k$ public-MS covering-b1 (**C52**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 --trials 8 \
      --bk-noise-sigma 128 --covering-base-log 1 --boolean-scale-mul 7
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths covering-b1 --boolean-scale-mul 7

Expect 8-trial $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-170$; Metal secret + public-ms PASS.

### Sequential covering counter (**C53**)

    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/counter_netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths covering-b1 --boolean-scale-mul 7

Same encoding as **C52**. Expect Metal secret + public-ms PASS. Not PicoRV.

### Sequential covering toy ISA (**C54**)

    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/toy_isa_netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths covering-b1 --boolean-scale-mul 7

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 --trials 8 \
      --bk-noise-sigma 128 --covering-base-log 1 --lwe-dimension 256

Omit `--lwe-dimension` for $n{=}N{=}1024$ (**C37**). Expect decodable $\varepsilon>-64$ at $n\le 512$; undecodable at $n{=}1024$. None $\le -64$.

### `cryptoPublicMS` plus $k{=}7$ (**C56**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 --trials 4 \
      --bk-noise 1 --boolean-scale-mul 7
    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/Examples/netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 1 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal public-ms crypto' \
      --boolean-scale-mul 7

Expect identity decodable at $B{=}1$ ($\varepsilon\approx-12.6$); Metal public-ms SING FAIL. Torus $\sigma{=}128$ still undecodable.

### Covering-b2 cheaper SING (**C57**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 --trials 4 \
      --bk-noise-sigma 128 --covering-base-log 2 --boolean-scale-mul 7

      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 1 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths 'public-ms covering-b2' --boolean-scale-mul 7

### PicoRV `abc -lut 6` (**C58**)

    mkdir -p build/hardware/PicoRV32
    yosys -p "read_verilog Hardware/RTL/Vendor/PicoRV32/picorv32.v; \

    .build/release/helut --bench build/hardware/PicoRV32/picorv32_lut6_netlist.json --degree 64 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 1 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate public-ms boolean'

Expect $2006$ LUT, PASS ${\sim}1.35\,\mathrm{s}/1$, $32$-bit. $N{=}8$ traps. Wavefront (**C59**): same command ${\sim}0.165\,\mathrm{s}/1$.

### PicoRV covering-b2 Q SING FAIL (**C60**)

    .build/release/helut --bench Generated/Netlists/PicoRV32/picorv32_lut6_netlist.json --degree 1024 \

Covering degree. Expect PASS and non-zero decodable $B_{\mathrm{bk}}$.

### TensorLUT Theorem 1 (**C19**)

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTFormalCertificate

Six lemmas must `hold`. Statement: `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md`. Not a U-534 / P1030680 decrypt.

### Enigma256 SoftBus Theorem 2 (**C24**)

    swift test -c release --filter testEnigma256FormalCertificate

Five lemmas must `hold`. Statement: `directives/enigma256-theorem.md`. Structural SoftBus contract---not IND-CPA.

### TensorLUT Theorem 1 corollary (**C25**)

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTFormalCorollaryCertificate

Emitter--discrete agreement and involution-under-freeze must `hold`. Statement: `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md` (corollary).

### TensorLUT melt--freeze--snap (**C44**)

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTMeltFreezeSnapCertificate

Three lemmas must `hold` (unique maximizer, snap basin, freeze). Statement: `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md` (Theorem 1$''$). Not multi-LUT topological melt.

### Encrypted PicoRV32 1-tick (**C45**)
