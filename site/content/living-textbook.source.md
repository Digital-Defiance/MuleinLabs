## How to read the living boxes {#how-to-read-the-living-boxes .unnumbered}

Four boxes appear throughout this book. They are not decoration; they are the difference between a textbook and a press release.

# How This Book Lives

## Preface {#ch:preface}

This book is the first teaching surface for a subject that did not have a name until the laboratory forced one.

Universities already teach *reconfigurable computing*: LUTs, interconnect, place-and-route, FPGA fabrics, high-level synthesis. They already teach *applied cryptography*: AES, RSA, lattices, sometimes a lecture on fully homomorphic encryption. They almost never teach what happens when the reconfigurable fabric *is* a machine-learning graph API, the bitstream is a Yosys netlist, and the values on the wires are torus samples that must remain encrypted while a host clock ticks flip-flops.

That intersection is the subject of this course. We call the working stack **HELUT**---Homomorphic Edge Look-Up Tensors---and we call the subject **reconfigurable homomorphic computing**.

The stack has three pillars [@helut-release; @helut-paper]:

1.  **Netlist-clocked torus FHE.** Gate-level sequential circuits evaluate as exact $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}$ tensor graphs, with real bootstrapping-key blind rotation and machine-checkable certificates.

2.  **Differentiable hardware cryptanalysis.** Discrete INIT tables melt into continuous tensors; a $\lambda$-squeeze grades shatter versus hold; reciprocal structure that combinatoric sieves miss can reappear as an involution.

3.  **Adversarial polymorphic ciphers.** Blue ciphers co-evolve under Red pressure and fail closed, rather than waiting to become the next historically leaked stream cipher.

###### Why a living textbook.

Research papers freeze a slice of a laboratory. This course cannot. The claim inventory [@helut-claim-sheet] moves: Metal kernels get faster, hedges close, avenues stay unlabeled until they earn receipts. A professor who taught from a PDF dated June would be teaching a different Metal compiler than a professor teaching from August. So the book is versioned against the corpus *epoch* (2026-08-13 / C48 in this edition) and is honest about stubs.

###### What this edition is.

Edition 0.1 is the *beginnings*: enough foundations to open a course, enough Pillar I to run laboratories, enough Pillars II and III to assign readings, and a frontier part that is labeled as frontier. It is not a complete treatise. Where the laboratory is thin, the page says so.

###### What this edition is not.

It is not a claim that HELUT invented TFHE [@chillotti2020tfhe; @ducas2015fhew]. It is not a production key-size manual until a lattice estimator fills the pending table (**H1**). It is not a decrypt of U-534 / P1030680. It is not a side-channel paper. Those sentences are printed again in Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"} because students will forget them the week before the final.

###### Who wrote it.

The HELUT project at Digital Defiance. The scientific voice of the book is the same voice as the research-release doctrine: lead with what runs, and with what it does not prove.

###### How to cite an epoch.

Cite the git commit and the claim-sheet epoch, not "the HELUT textbook" as if it were a static ISBN. When a student reproduces **C18**, they are reproducing a dated Metal NTT persist tile, not an eternal constant of nature.

## To the instructor {#ch:instructor}

You are being asked to teach a class that does not yet appear in the ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines under that name. This chapter is the briefing.

### The course in one paragraph

Students learn to treat a *synthesized gate netlist* as the universal intermediate representation of reconfigurable computing, to lower that netlist onto a *tensor engine* (here: Apple Silicon `MPSGraph`), and to evaluate it either as a boolean-faithful oracle or as torus FHE with certificates. They then learn a second compiler direction---melting discrete hardware into continuous tensors---and a third: designing ciphers that are born under adversarial pressure. The moral of the course is not "FHE is fast on a laptop." The moral is: *reconfigurable computing has a new fabric, and honesty about what that fabric proves is part of the engineering.*

### Prerequisites

::: center
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Required**       Digital logic (LUTs, flip-flops, timing) [@harris2012digital]; linear algebra; a first crypto course (modular arithmetic, attack models) [@paar2009crypto].
  **Helpful**        One HDL (Verilog or VHDL); one systems language; Yosys as a black box [@yosys].
  **Not required**   Prior FHE, prior Metal, prior Swift, prior lattice cryptography. The torus chapter is self-contained at the level this course needs.
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

### Two tracks

Not every department can put an M-series Mac in front of every student.

Systems track.

: Apple Silicon laboratory. Students build, tick, and certificate-read HELUT from `REPRODUCE.md`. Labs [2](#ch:lab){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:lab"} assume this track.

Theory track.

: No GPU required. Students work the five-cell test, noise lemmas, and published logs as *data*. A department can still grade a claim-audit final (below).

A mixed offering works: theory problem sets for everyone; systems labs as a project option or a second section.

### Suggested grading

::: center
  Weight   Instrument                           Why it exists
  -------- ------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  30%      Problem sets                         Negacyclic arithmetic, packing, certificate reading.
  40%      Laboratories or theory equivalents   Receipts, not vibes.
  20%      **Claim audit**                      Take a public sentence; run the five-cell test from Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"}. Fail the assignment if the student upgrades a hedge to a theorem.
  10%      Frontier essay                       Pick one avenue from Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}. Must label it frontier. Must propose the *first experiment* that would graduate it.
:::

The claim audit is the signature assignment of this course. It trains the skill the field currently lacks: refusing to launder an open hedge into a keynote.

### What to lecture, what to assign as reading

- **Lecture** Parts II--III (foundations and Pillar I), the honesty chapter, and Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} (**C19**).

- **Seminar** Pillar II empirics (shatter / hold, campaign as case study) and Pillar III in edition 0.1. Do not lecture shatter grades as if they were Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"}.

- **Do not lecture as fact** Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}. Give it as the last two seminars, with the frontier boxes left on the slides.

### How to pull a new edition mid-semester

Science will move under your feet. That is the point of a living textbook.

1.  Diff `directives/claim-sheet.md` against the epoch printed on the title page.

2.  If a new **C** row appeared, assign the matching lab receipt as a one-page addendum; do not pretend the old PDF contained it.

3.  If an **H** closed, tell the class explicitly: "this asterisk is gone; here is the log."

4.  If only frontier text moved, do not change the midterm.

Bump `\livingepoch` in `textbook/preamble.tex` when you accept an addendum. Cite git.

### Classroom norms

- Trivial / mock torus encodings are a *shape laboratory*, not FHE. Students who call the boolean oracle "encrypted computing" lose points on purpose.

- Campaign cryptanalysis (Enigma / P1030680) is a *case study* in Pillar II methods, not the FHE claim, and not a decrypt.

- Speculative systems (encrypted LLM firewalls, self-modifying dark binaries, honey-token ledgers) are ethics-and-design discussions, not implementation homework, until they have **C** rows.

## The living contract {#ch:living}

### Why a textbook needs a contract

Ordinary textbooks accrete errata. This one accretes *science*. Without a contract, the lecture slides of 2027 will still be quoting a fused `MPSGraph` megagraph that the laboratory killed in August 2026, or---worse---will quote a speculative avenue as if it were a theorem.

The contract is the research-release doctrine [@helut-release] translated into pedagogy.

### The three inventories

Every public sentence in HELUT is classified in `directives/claim-sheet.md`:

::: center
  Tag        Name                  Classroom meaning
  ---------- --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **C$n$**   Reproducible result   You may lecture it. Students may cite it. Someone else can re-run it [@helut-claim-sheet].
  **H$n$**   Open hedge            You may discuss it. You must keep the asterisk. A problem-set "true/false" that drops the asterisk is false.
  **N$n$**   Non-implication       You must actively prevent this inference. It is a common exam trap.
:::

A fourth class lives only in this book and in `directives/potential-avenues.md`:

::: center
  Frontier   Not a claim until it has a **C** row and a reproduce command. Seminar fuel. Never a midterm fact.
  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

### The five-cell test

For an atomic claim $C$, the doctrine requires all five, or $C$ is hedged:

1.  **Proof** --- lemma, reduction, or graded empirical protocol with pass/fail.

2.  **Table** --- parameters, comparisons, or grades.

3.  **Metric** --- a number with units and a bar.

4.  **Examples** --- at least two concrete, runnable instances.

5.  **Application** --- at least one end-to-end reason to care.

::: example
**Example 3.1** (Five cells for **C18**). Metal 3-prime NTT persist blind-rotate. Proof: CPU$+$Metal NTT $\equiv$ schoolbook (19 tests) plus microbench PASS bits. Table: $N\in\{64,1024\}$ s/BR versus schoolbook persist and fused-EP. Metric: $0.433\,\mathrm{s}$/BR at $N=1024$ (gpu $0.43\,\mathrm{s}$, RSS $148\,\mathrm{MiB}$). Examples: microbench identity LUT; full_adder boolean SING (**S**timuli **In**, **G**olden out---encrypted evaluation must match the cleartext netlist on the same generic vectors; see Chapter [1](#ch:pillari){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillari"}). Application: production-shaped polynomial degree on a laptop GPU graph.
:::

::: example
**Example 3.2** (Five cells for **C19**). TensorLUT continuous$\to$discrete Theorem 1 [@helut-tensorlut-thm]. Proof: six `TensorLUTFormal.check*` lemmas, aggregated by `certificate()`. Table: lemma vs `holds`; campaign grades kept separate. Metric: $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}=0$ on unmutated baseline; $\pi=0$ on binary INIT. Examples: M4 baseline emit; freeze-core involution; blind 3-pair PASS. Application: a stecker search that cannot propose a non-reciprocal map. Asterisk: structural, not a U-534 break (**H6**).
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.1** (Claim audit). Take any sentence from a blog post, a grant abstract, or last year's slide deck about "encrypted computing on a Neural Engine." Fill the five cells or mark the sentence a non-claim. If you cannot name the log file, it is not a **C** row.
:::

### Disclosure versus discovery

::: center
                 Disclosure package                       Trajectory
  -------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Goal           Someone else re-runs what we assert      We know what to invent next
  Artifact       `REPRODUCE.md`, logs, reproduced boxes   trajectory file, Chapter [3](#ch:open){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:open"}
  Failure mode   Unreproducible hype                      Silence / no next experiment
:::

When a trajectory item graduates, it earns a **C** row (or a tightened **H**) and a reproduce command---*then* it may enter lecture voice. That sentence is the entire editorial policy of this book.

### Standing non-claims

Print these on the course website.

### How a chapter grows

1.  A laboratory result lands in a log under `logs/`.

2.  A **C** or **H** row is updated in the claim sheet.

3.  The matching chapter gains an example, a table row, or a converted box; `\livingepoch` bumps.

4.  The syllabus appendix does *not* automatically change. Instructors opt in (Chapter [2](#ch:instructor){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:instructor"}).

# Foundations of the Subject

## A new subject {#ch:subject}

### The gap between two mature fields

Reconfigurable computing classically means: a designer writes RTL, a synthesizer emits LUTs and flip-flops, a bitstream configures an FPGA, and the fabric evaluates the circuit at a clock [@harris2012digital; @gajski2009embedded]. The fabric is spatially wired. The configuration is a bitstream. The values on the wires are bits.

Fully homomorphic encryption classically means: a scheme evaluates circuits *on ciphertexts* [@chillotti2020tfhe; @ducas2015fhew]. The "fabric" is an arithmetic library---NTT butterflies, key-switching decompositions, bootstrapping. The configuration is a parameter set. The values on the wires are polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^N+1)$.

Each field has textbooks. The composition does not.

::: definition
**Definition 1.1** (Reconfigurable homomorphic computing). The study of compiling *already-synthesized* sequential netlists onto *tensor engines* so that LUT evaluation, flip-flop clocking, and (when claimed) torus FHE occupy the same graph object, with explicit certificates of what the graph does and does not prove.
:::

HELUT is one laboratory realization of that definition: Yosys JSON in, `MPSGraph` out, host posedge clock, LWE/GLWE samples on the FHE path [@helut-paper]. The subject is larger than the prototype. A future chapter may describe a CUDA fabric, an MLIR fabric, or an ASIC LUT plane. The definition does not name Apple.

### Three questions that open the course

1.  **Representation.** Can a commodity ML graph API host exact modular arithmetic at $q=2^{32}$, or does the API silently round?

2.  **Clocking.** Can sequential logic---enables, sync resets, a RISC-V core---tick on that graph without the host becoming a bit-banged FPGA?

3.  **Honesty.** When the same object grows a real bootstrapping key, what certificates must ship with every tick, and which sentences remain forbidden?

Pillar I is the constructive answer to (1)--(3). Pillar II asks a fourth question the FPGA curriculum never asked: *what if the INIT table is not binary?* Pillar III asks a fifth: *what if the circuit under evaluation is allowed to mutate because the attacker in the next room is the same compiler?*

### Why "reconfigurable" is the right word

An FPGA is reconfigurable because the LUT INIT bits and the interconnect are late-bound. HELUT is reconfigurable in the same sense, with three substitutions:

::: center
  Classical FPGA       This course                   Consequence
  -------------------- ----------------------------- --------------------------------------
  LUT INIT bitstream   Yosys `$lut` truth table      Same IR
  Routing fabric       Tensor edges in one graph     Place-and-route becomes lowering
  Clock tree           Host `graph.run` loop         Timing closure becomes tick protocol
  IOB / BRAM           Placeholders and MTLBuffers   Memory is unified, not dual-port
  Encrypted?           Optional; certificate-gated   Oracle $\neq$ FHE
:::

The last row is the pedagogical load-bearing wall. Students who have built FPGAs want to say "the CPU is encrypted" the moment PicoRV32 ticks. The boolean oracle path *does* clock PicoRV32 on ciphertext-*shaped* vectors (**C1**). The FHE path *does* fetch NOPs on encrypted PicoRV32 at demo $N{=}8$ (**C47**): the PC walks $0,4,\ldots$, with decrypted $Q$ matching cleartext. Chapter [3](#ch:certs){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:certs"} exists so that confusion is a grading event rather than a press cycle.

### The three pillars as a curriculum, not a brand

Roadmap language names them the Turing pillar, the Schneier pillar, and a grand challenge on proving circuits [@helut-trajectory]. In this course they are simply I, II, III, in the order a student can verify them:

- Without I, II is a float32 netlist toy and III has nowhere to run.

- Without II, I is a compiler course with FHE homework.

- Without III, I and II only attack the past; they do not design the next cipher under fire.

Edition 0.1 teaches I in lecture depth, Pillar II Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} (**C19**) in lecture depth with empirics in seminar, Pillar III in seminar depth, and the grand-challenge / side-channel items as labeled frontier (Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}).

### Related systems, scoped not ranked

::: center
  System                   Exact $q{=}2^{32}$ Metal   Netlist clock   BK `$lut` FHE   Diff. hardware
  ----------------------- -------------------------- --------------- --------------- ----------------
  Concrete / tfhe-rs                  --               compiler IR         yes              --
  OpenFHE / HElib                     --               circuit API         yes              --
  HELUT boolean oracle               yes                   yes             --               --
  HELUT encrypted path               yes                   yes             yes              --
  TensorLUT (Pillar II)               --               Yosys INIT          --              yes
:::

This is a *scope* matrix, not a throughput bake-off [@helut-paper]. Concrete is a production TFHE compiler; HELUT is a netlist-clocked tensor fabric with an FHE path. Students comparing "ms/gate" across those rows without naming encoding, $N$, and certificate status fail the five-cell test.

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.1**. Write four sentences, one per row of the matrix, that a journalist could print without creating a **N**. Then write the one-sentence lie each row most tempts.
:::

## Netlists as the universal IR {#ch:reconf}

### From RTL to LUTs

A combinational Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}$ is exactly a truth table of $2^k$ bits. FPGA vendors package that table as a $k$-input look-up table. Yosys [@yosys] emits the same object after `abc -lut 2` (or 4, or 6) as a cell of type `$lut` with a parameter string INIT.

::: definition
**Definition 2.1** (Yosys `$lut`). A combinational cell whose output bit is INIT indexed by the concatenated input bits. HELUT treats every `$lut` as one programmable gate, whether the backend is a multilinear oracle or a TFHE blind rotate.
:::

Sequential logic is a `$_DFF*` (or enable / sync-reset variant). The clock is not a net in the tensor graph: it is a *host protocol* (Chapter [1](#ch:pillari){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillari"}). That substitution---clock as protocol, not as a routed tree---is the first reconfigurable-computing heresy of the course, and it is load-bearing. Tensor engines do not give you a global posedge. They give you `graph.run`.

### Why we start from synthesized netlists

High-level FHE compilers start from a language and lower to homomorphic ops. HELUT starts from a *netlist that already exists*: PicoRV32, a regex DFA, a decision tree, an Enigma core [@picorv32]. The pedagogical reason is the same as the systems reason:

- The IR is stable. Verilog front-ends change; `$lut` does not.

- Sequential depth is explicit. Multiplicative depth in an arithmetic circuit is a metaphor; DFF count is a fact.

- Any HDL, any synthesizer that can emit Yosys JSON, is in scope.

- Cryptanalysis targets (historical machines, stream ciphers) already *are* netlists.

::: remark
*Remark 2.1*. Starting from netlists does not make HELUT "better than Concrete." It makes it a different compiler problem: *spatial* Boolean fabric onto a graph API, not *scalar* program onto PBS.
:::

### The four objects a student must be able to draw

1.  **A LUT** as a box with INIT and $k$ wires.

2.  **A DFF** as a box whose $Q$ at tick $t+1$ is a mux of $D$, enable, and reset, evaluated *between* graph runs.

3.  **A batch axis $B$** as $B$ independent copies of the same fabric in one run---the reconfigurable analog of SIMD, and the reason a Bombe search is a tensor problem.

4.  **A polynomial degree $N$** as the *ciphertext shape*, not the circuit size. $N=1$ is clear-shape boolean. $N=1024$ is TFHE-shaped. Confusing $N$ with LUT count is the most common homework error in week 2.

### Worked lowering: a half-adder

A half-adder is two gates: $\mathrm{sum}=A\oplus B$, $\mathrm{carry}=A\land B$. Under additive torus encoding, XOR is a vector add (free). AND is a LUT (or a PBS).

::: example
**Example 2.1** (Half-adder as a graph). Yosys emits (typically) one `$lut` for the AND and uses an add/xor cell or a second LUT for the sum, depending on techmap. HELUT's Phase-2 compiler [@helut-paper] lowers this to placeholders for $A,B$, an add node, a LUT node, and output binds---one persistent `MPSGraph`. There is no FPGA routing step. The "place-and-route" *is* the tensor edge list.
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 2.1**. Synthesize a 1-bit full adder with Yosys (`abc -lut 2`) and count `$lut` versus `$_DFF*` cells. Then argue, in four sentences, why the encrypted SING of that netlist is a better first FHE lab than PicoRV32. (PicoRV32 is **C1** on the *oracle* path; the encrypted path's multi-LUT workhorse is the adder, **C6**.)
:::

### Batch is a first-class capacity knob

On an FPGA, duplicating a circuit costs LUTs. On a tensor engine, duplicating a circuit is a batch dimension $B$ on every placeholder. Memory scales as the broadcast intermediates, not as "more CLBs."

At $N=1024$, $B=1000$, Enigma M3's TFHE-shaped working set is gigabytes while clear-shape $N=1$ stays flat. Students designing a "just crank $B$" attack are designing a memory bomb. That is a reconfigurable-computing lesson, not an FHE lesson.

::: exercise
**Exercise 2.2**. Using only the boolean-path scale table in the HELUT README (epoch of this edition), plot tick time versus $B$ at $N=1$ and $N=1024$. Identify the regime where graph overhead dominates $N$, and the regime where $N=1024$ becomes memory-bound.
:::

### What this chapter refuses to call a bitstream

A Metal graph executable is late-bound, cached, and device-specific. It is tempting to call it a bitstream. We do not, yet. A bitstream has a documented configuration memory; an `MPSGraphExecutable` has an Apple runtime. The analogy is useful in lecture and false on an exam. Chapter [2](#ch:metal){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:metal"} returns to this when the compiler stops unrolling schoolbook arithmetic into MLIR and starts calling ring kernels.

## Torus arithmetic and programmable bootstrapping {#ch:torus}

This chapter is a working minimum of TFHE [@chillotti2020tfhe; @ducas2015fhew], not a substitute for a lattice-crypto course. The goal is that a student can read a HELUT certificate line without bluffing.

### The torus and the native word

::: definition
**Definition 3.1** (Discrete torus used here). HELUT freezes the modulus $q=2^{32}$ and represents torus elements as `UInt32`. Addition is native wraparound. This is a *systems* choice: the machine word *is* the torus.
:::

The ring of polynomials is $$R_q = \mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^N+1),$$ the negacyclic ring. Multiplication by $X$ is a rotation with a sign flip on wrap-around---the algebraic fact that makes blind rotation a barrel shifter on coefficients.

::: warning
*Honesty note 3.1*. Exact $\mathrm{mod}\,2^{32}$ integer tensors are not "homomorphic encryption." They are the arithmetic. Encryption begins when those tensors are LWE or GLWE *samples* with a secret and noise.
:::

### LWE samples, in one page

::: definition
**Definition 3.2** (LWE sample [@regev2005lwe]). For secret $s\in\mathbb{Z}_q^n$, a sample is $(a,\langle a,s\rangle+e+m)\in\mathbb{Z}_q^n\times\mathbb{Z}_q$, with $a$ uniform and $e$ small Gaussian (or discrete) noise. GLWE is the polynomial analog: mask polynomials plus a body polynomial in $R_q$.
:::

HELUT's encrypted path uses LWE/GLWE samples and GGSW bootstrap keys. Decision-LWE is bound to IND-CPA by a machine-checkable certificate (**C5**); the bit estimate at production $(n,\sigma)=(1024,2^{16})$ is calibrated $\sim 176$ and is *not* a lattice-estimator attack cost until Sage fills the pending JSON (**H1**).

### Programmable bootstrapping, sketched

A TFHE Boolean gate is often evaluated by programmable bootstrapping (PBS): an encrypted phase selects a coefficient of a *test polynomial* via *blind rotation*, then a sample extract returns an LWE encryption of the LUT output.

Blind rotation is a product of CMUXes, one per bit of the encrypted phase. Each CMUX is an external product against a GGSW encrypt of a secret bit. The accumulator lives in $R_q$ (a GLWE). The sequential dependence across the $N$ (or $n$) bits is real: you cannot parallelize away the chain inside one bootstrap. You *can* refuse to unroll each external product into $O(N)$ host MLIR nodes. That refusal is Chapter [2](#ch:metal){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:metal"}.

### Negacyclic Toeplitz embedding

Let $A(X)=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}a_i X^i$. Negacyclic convolution against a vector $x$ is $M_A x$, where $M_A$ is the Toeplitz matrix whose first column is $(a_0,\ldots,a_{N-1})^\top$ and each subsequent column is the previous column rotated downward with the wrapped entry *negated* [@lyubashevsky2010ideal].

::: example
**Example 3.1** ($N=4$ by hand). Let $A=(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3)$. Then $$M_A
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_0 & -a_3 & -a_2 & -a_1 \\
a_1 &  a_0 & -a_3 & -a_2 \\
a_2 &  a_1 &  a_0 & -a_3 \\
a_3 &  a_2 &  a_1 &  a_0
\end{pmatrix}.$$ On `UInt32`, $-a\equiv 2^{32}-a$. The matrix product *is* the ring product. HELUT's Phase-1 kernel proved this bit-exact against a CPU schoolbook oracle, including torus corners $\{0,1,2^{31},2^{32}-1\}$.
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.1**. Expand $M_A$ for $A=(1,2,3,4)$ over $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}$ and multiply by $x=(1,0,0,0)^\top$. Interpret the output as a polynomial. Then multiply by $x=(0,1,0,0)^\top$ and explain the sign that appears.
:::

###### Why dense Toeplitz is not the FHE hot path.

Materializing $N\times N$ at $N=1024$ is $\Theta(N^2)$ words per LUT---a kernel proof and a memory stress, not a production PBS. The encrypted hot path moved through tiled schoolbook, fused external product, GPU-resident tiles, and 3-prime NTT (**C16**--**C18**). Students implementing "the HELUT paper kernel" as their FHE engine are implementing 2026-era Phase 1, which the compiler chapter treats as a *control-plane ancestor*.

### Message spacing and $Z_{2N}$

Blind rotation addresses coefficients at granularity $\delta = q/(2N)$. Packing several LWE bits into one phase must respect the cyclic group $Z_{2N}$, not an integer that merely looks like a power.

That closed hedge is the best homework in the chapter: a systems bug that is also an algebraic bug.

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.2**. Suppose $N=256$ so $2N=512$. A pack of three bits each scaled by $256$ can leave the $2N$ range. Show a numeric counterexample, then write the reduction that restores a valid rotation power.

### Noise, in the sense this course needs

Three layers ship as code, not as vibes (**C5**):

  `TFHENoiseProof`                     Discrete $\infty$-norm inject lemmas.
  Gaussian $\varepsilon$-certificate   Ingest failure $\le 2^{-64}$ under independent-noise hypotheses.
  `TFHENoisyBKCertificate`             Depth under a BK-noise bound $B_{\mathrm{bk}}$. Default Metal SING still encrypts BK with $e=0$. **C22** fills $B_{\mathrm{bk}}/\hat\sigma$ from identity-LUT residuals on a covering gadget ($N=8$: inject $B=64\to\hat\sigma\approx 6396$; $N=128$: $\hat\sigma\approx 1.47\times 10^6$, still $<\delta/2$, Gaussian $\varepsilon\log_2\approx -23.5$ not $-64$). $\ell=1$ `booleanPublicMS` cannot carry BK noise (**H4**).

*Honesty note 3.2*. A noiseless BK is a correct *functional* bootstrap and an incomplete *depth* story. **C22** measures residuals; it does not put noisy BK on the $N=1024$ Metal SING path.

# Pillar I --- Netlist-Clocked Torus FHE

## Netlist-clocked torus FHE {#ch:pillari}

Pillar I is the reason the course exists: a synthesized sequential circuit becomes one tensor graph, ticked by the host, with an encrypted backend that is actually LWE.

### The HELUT question

> *Can Apple Silicon's `MPSGraph` host exact torus modular arithmetic and gate-level sequential circuits---and can that same hardware object carry real bootstrapping keys without lying about it?*

The first half is a systems existence proof. The second half is a certificate problem. HELUT answers both, with the oracle path and the FHE path named as different objects [@helut-paper; @helut-release].

### Pipeline

::: center
:::

All FHE-path arithmetic tensors remain `MPSDataType.uInt32`. Float32 belongs to TensorLUT (Pillar II), not to this chapter.

### Compiler lowering

`YosysGraphCompiler` walks a `write_json` module:

1.  **Inputs.** Each input port bit becomes an `InputNode` placeholder of shape $[B,N]$.

2.  **State.** Each recognized flip-flop allocates a $Q$ placeholder *before* LUT lowering so sequential feedback nets resolve.

3.  **LUTs.** Cells schedule until all drivers exist; combinational cycles abort.

4.  **Next-state.** Enables and sync-resets become exact $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}$ muxes, e.g. active-high enable $$Q_{\mathrm{next}} = E\cdot D + (1-E)\cdot Q.$$

5.  **Outputs.** Driven nets bind to port tensors; Yosys `"x"` becomes constant 0.

Cell coverage includes `$_DFF*`, `$_DFFE*`, `$_SDFF*`, `$_SDFFE*`, `$_SDFFCE*`---the techmap PicoRV32 actually emits.

### Host clock

Each tick is one `graph.run`. With `retainHistory=false`, two preallocated state buffer sets ping-pong and output scratch is reused, so a 1 000-tick stress test does not leak `MTLBuffer` retention. Primary port feeds (including scripted `resetn`) are host-mutable shared buffers; LUT matrices or BK packs are uploaded once and cached.

This is the reconfigurable clock tree: not routed silicon, but a protocol with explicit buffer ownership.

### SING as the teaching metric {#sec:sing}

**SING** expands to **S**timuli **In**, **G**olden out.

In hardware verification, a *golden model* is the flawless reference circuit: feed test vectors (stimuli) in, expect the exact right bits out. For HELUT the golden model is the cleartext Yosys netlist simulator. A SING check (`--sing` / `--bench-encrypted-metrics`) is the primary teaching metric and the laboratory analogue of a scan chain: encrypt the same generic stimuli, evaluate under GGSW blind-rotate, decrypt, and demand bit-exact agreement with cleartext.

A passing encrypted tick under SING is not only a boolean match. The log is graded as a cryptographic bundle:

- **Functional:** ciphertext decrypts to the clear netlist (the hard gate).

- **Discrete:** $\infty$-norm inject lemmas hold where the path prints them.

- **Gaussian:** ingest failure probabilities stay under stated hypotheses.

- **Hardness:** calibrated classical bit estimates print with **H1** attached until the estimator row is honest.

- **Depth:** noisy bootstrap-key residuals are modeled or measured; default Track A throughput SING may still use $e{=}0$ BK (**H4**); covering noisy SING receipts are separate claims (**C28**, **C33**--**C37**, **C41**, **C43**).

Brutal engineering rule: if SING fails, you do not get to discuss milliseconds. Throughput and timing benches are irrelevant until the FHE path certifies its own correctness against the golden netlist.

::: lab

:::

Inter-LUT refresh defaults to `publicMS` (lattice-compatible BK masks). `.secret` remains for coverage. `.none` is a debug foot-gun.

### Why PicoRV32 is real in FHE, with a speed qualifier

PicoRV32 lowers to 4 785 LUTs and 1 565 DFFs [@picorv32]. On the boolean-oracle path it compiles in ${\sim}1.3\,\mathrm{s}$ and ticks at ${\sim}173\,\mathrm{ms}$ ($N=1024$, $B=1$) in the 2026-08-12 boolean bench (**C1**). That is a fabric existence proof: a commodity neural/GPU graph can host a soft CPU's *shape*.

The encrypted path uses the same host-clocked sequential seam as the toy counter (**C38**) and toy ISA (**C40**). Claim **C45** is one encrypted host posedge of the full PicoRV32 netlist at demo $N{=}8$ (output SING). Claim **C46** is the PRD 10-tick scripted `resetn` boot at the same $N$: CPU public-ms boolean SING PASS in $0.972\,\mathrm{s}$ ($97.20\,\mathrm{ms}$/row), calibrated hardness $4.0$ bits, with decrypted $Q$ matching the clear register file. A second public-MS on already-native $D$ for plain `$_DFF_P_` cells had been silently folding $1\to 0$ --- outputs could still match. Metal $N{=}1024$ is not SING-logged this epoch --- the LUT-tax is the remaining engineering, not a missing compiler.

*Honesty note 1.1*. "We executed encrypted RISC-V" means **C47**: NOP fetches, PC walked by 4, demo $N$, idle data RAM. Avenue 2 in Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"} is self-modifying dark code, not this receipt.

The split is intentional. If the tensor datapath cannot boot a CPU under mock encodings, adding real TFHE noise only makes the systems problem harder. If the FHE path cannot SING an adder, a CPU slide is theatre.

## The Metal torus compiler {#ch:metal}

### The picture that changed the compiler

                                     +-- design: small graph that *calls* ring kernels
                                         encode cheap; run on Metal; cache

CMUX dependence across bootstrap bits is sequential and real. The pain was never "CMUX cannot run on a GPU." The pain was *encoding a schoolbook expansion that should never have been a graph* [@helut-metal].

### Doctrine

SoftBus / ANE remains a graph machine. We stop mistaking "unroll all ring math into MLIR" for "use the GPU." `MPSGraph` is a *staged IR* and a *scheduler*. Polynomial multiplication and the external product are first-class GPU operations.

### Phase 1 --- survive $N=1024$

Phase 1 does not change the cryptography. It changes the control plane.

::: center

  Executable cache     Compile once per $(N,\ell,W,\mathrm{BK})$   Trial 1 is cold; ticks $\ge 2$ must hit cache.
  Telemetry            `encode` / `gpu_run` / `host_repack`        Silence is not a hang if the log counts tiles.
:::

Phase 1 without Phase 2 still leaves $O(W\cdot N)$ encode inside each tile. Phase 2 without Phase 1 is a kernel drop into an unmeasured fused path. The laboratory did both, in that order.

### Phase 2 --- ring kernels

1.  **Negacyclic poly-mul** as a Metal kernel, bit-identical to CPU schoolbook (**C18** NTT $\equiv$ schoolbook, 19 tests).

2.  **Fused external product** (**C16**): one `helut_ggsw_external_product` launch per CMUX. $N=1024$ microbench $1.043\,\mathrm{s}$/BR.

3.  **GPU-resident BR tile** (**C17**): ACC $+$ BK on device; $0.519\,\mathrm{s}$/BR at $N=1024$; $N=64$ at $0.001\,\mathrm{s}$/BR.

4.  **3-prime NTT persist tile** (**C18**): gadget digits in-tile; BK in NTT domain; pointwise EP $+$ iNTT $+$ CRT. $0.433\,\mathrm{s}$/BR at $N=1024$ (gpu $0.43\,\mathrm{s}$, RSS $148\,\mathrm{MiB}$).

Default Metal BR: fused if $N\le 64$, tiled-kernel otherwise (NTT EP inside tiles). Legacy fused megagraph is `--metal-br-fused` only, and at production $N$ it is a museum exhibit.

### Punchline, for the lecture slide

Phase 1 makes encoding *finish*. Phase 2 makes encoding *irrelevant*. Together they are a SoftBus-native torus compiler: staged IR $+$ ring kernels $+$ cached executables---instead of a schoolbook megagraph hoping the GPU will eventually appear.

## Certificates as first-class artifacts {#ch:certs}

Most compiler courses grade a binary that runs. This course grades a binary that *refuses* when it cannot certify.

### How to read a SING log

**SING** $=$ **S**timuli **In**, **G**olden out (Section [1.5](#sec:sing){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:sing"}): encrypted evaluation must match the cleartext netlist on the same generic vectors. A passing encrypted tick is then read as a bundle:

- Functional: ciphertext decrypts to the clear netlist (the SING gate).

- Discrete: $\infty$-norm lemmas held on the inject.

- Gaussian: ingest $\varepsilon$ under the stated hypotheses.

- Hardness: calibrated classical bits, with **H1** attached until Sage fills the estimator JSON.

- Depth: noisy-BK model; **C22** measured at covering gadget; **C26** graded fail at product $N{=}1024$ inject on `cryptoPublicMS`; covering noisy Metal SING exists through inject $B{=}32$ (**C36**); torus-scale $B{\sim}128$ and default Track A $e{=}0$ BK remain **H4** asterisks.

Students who report only milliseconds have not completed the lab.

### Five-cell test, applied to certificates

Certificates are themselves claims. They need the five cells:

1.  Proof: the lemma in code (`TFHENoiseProof`, ...).

2.  Table: the calibration table; the cookbook production row.

3.  Metric: $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$; bit estimates; $B_{\mathrm{bk}}$.

4.  Examples: demo $N=8$ (honest fail of 128-bit) and production $N=1024$.

5.  Application: refuse-closed encrypt so a netlist tick cannot silently drop hardness.

::: exercise
**Exercise 3.1**. **C22** filled the measurement cell at covering-gadget $N=8$ and $N=128$. Which cell is still missing for noisy BK as a *product* parameter at $N=1024$ Metal SING? Name the gadget obstruction ($\ell=1$ vs covering).
:::

### Honesty as an engineering interface

The non-claims of Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"} are not ethics theater. They are API documentation for speech:

- Oracle Metal graphs expose the *shape* of encrypted evaluation (batch, $N$, clock). They do not expose Decision-LWE.

- `publicMS` is an on-lattice refresh intent. It is not a leakage proof (**N** on side channels).

- A campaign's settings/second is a cleartext Metal number. It does not certify encrypted tick rate.

# Pillar II --- Differentiable Hardware

## Continuous hardware, discrete silicon {#ch:pillarii}

The structural theorem of this chapter is lecture-safe (**C19**). The separable melt--freeze--snap certificate is lecture-safe (**C44**). Shatter / hold grades and campaign empirics remain seminar-depth and are *not* the theorem [@helut-tensorlut-thm].

### The problem boolean search cannot see

A combinatoric sieve on a cipher netlist proposes discrete genotypes: INIT bits, plugboard pairs, rotor orders. On a short ciphertext the search space is both enormous and full of linguistic hallucinations (the P1030680 campaign is the case study, not the claim). Boolean search *rejects*. It does not *propose* a nearby reciprocal structure that is almost a stecker.

Pillar II melts the hardware [@helut-paper; @helut-tensorlut-thm].

### Setup

Let $L$ be the number of LUT6 cells and $w\in[0,1]^{64L}$ the concatenated INIT genome. Let $y(w)$ be the *multilinear extension* of those INITs on $[0,1]$ (exact on $\{0,1\}$ inputs). Let $t$ be a target bit vector of matching width. Soft crypto fitness and discreteness penalty: $$\begin{align}
  F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)
  &= -\lVert y(w)-t\rVert_2^2, \\
  \pi(w)
  &= \sum_i w_i(1-w_i), \\
  F(w)
  &= F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)-\lambda\,\pi(w),
  \qquad \lambda\ge 0.
\end{align}$$

::: remark
*Remark 1.1* (Implementation schedule). HELUT's GA uses a squeeze $\lambda=\lambda_{\max}(p')^2$. Theorem 1 needs only $\lambda\ge 0$.
:::

Emitter: $E(w)_i=\mathbf{1}[w_i\ge\tfrac12]$. Freeze mask $M\subseteq\{1,\dots,64L\}$ removes frozen coordinates from $\pi$. Stecker genotypes are *partial involutions* (disjoint pairs) on $\{0,\dots,25\}$.

Every Yosys `$lut` of width $1\ldots 6$ pads to a 64-wide `Float32` INIT. The forward pass is branchless and GPU-shaped. It is not torus FHE.

### Theorem 1 (structural) {#sec:thm-tensorlut}

::: {#thm:tensorlut .theorem}
**Theorem 1.1** (TensorLUT continuous$\to$discrete). *Assume the hypotheses on the certificate: the LUT is multilinear; the GA mutates only unfrozen $w_i\in[0,1]$; the involution sandwich freezes core INITs. Then:*

1.  ***Discreteness.** $\pi(w)\ge 0$, with equality iff $w\in\{0,1\}^{64L}$.*

2.  ***Crypto MSE.** $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)\le 0$, with equality iff $y(w)=t$.*

3.  ***Combined objective.** $F(w)\le F_{\mathrm{crypto}}(w)$; if $\pi(w)>0$, increasing $\lambda$ strictly decreases $F$.*

4.  ***Emitter.** $E$ is idempotent on $\{0,1\}^{64L}$ and agrees with threshold $\tfrac12$.*

5.  ***Involution sandwich.** Overlapping pairs are rejected; applying a valid pair-set twice is the identity on the alphabet.*

6.  ***Freeze.** Coordinates in $M$ do not contribute to $\pi$.*

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.1** (Read a certificate). Run the reproduce filter (Appendix [4](#app:repro){reference-type="ref" reference="app:repro"}) or, on the theory track, read `TensorLUTFormal.certificate()` and list the six `holds` bits. For each lemma, write one sentence a journalist may print and one they may not.
:::

### Shatter versus hold (empirical)

A full cold-start on a large sequential cipher discovers continuous shortcuts that *shatter* when $\lambda$ rises: $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}$ looks perfect in float and dies on the Boolean cube. Targeted melting freezes known-good LUT blocks (`freezeMask`) and evolves only the unknown cone---clause 6 of Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} is why frozen coordinates do not pay $\pi$. Early resignation reboots doomed lineages rather than squeezing a reciprocal shortcut to the end.

::: definition
**Definition 1.1** (Grade). Under a published $\lambda$ schedule, a lineage **holds** if the emitted binary netlist preserves $F_{\mathrm{crypto}}=0$ (or a stated bar). It **shatters** if discreteness kills the continuous solution. Both grades are science. Shatter is not a failed demo; it is evidence about shortcuts. It is *not* a clause of Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"}.
:::

### Involution sandwich

Stecker genotypes are partial involutions (disjoint pairs) by construction (Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"}, clause 5). The GA cannot propose a non-reciprocal map. The 16 cone LUTs around an identity plugboard cannot invent letter swaps by INIT melt; the sandwich injects $S(\mathrm{CT})$ into a frozen core and scores soft PT against bits of $S(P)$. Reciprocity is structural.

::: warning
*Honesty note 1.3*. Short cribs leave unused pairs unconstrained and can admit false $F=0$ steckers. Grade active-map agreement on $\mathrm{CT}\cup\mathrm{PT}$, use parsimony, grow the pair budget on plateau, and allow soft freeze $+$ thaw. TensorLUT grades are not a campaign decrypt (**N**, **H6**).
:::

### Adversarial synthesis as a compiler loop

Forward: silicon $\to$ uniform float tensors. Reverse: cooled tensors $\to$ INIT hex $\to$ Verilog LUT instantiations. The loop is a generative compiler pitting continuous optimization against discrete physical limits [@helut-release]. Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} is the invariant the loop is forced to obey. It is not a guarantee that the loop finds a key.

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.2**. Why must $\pi(w)=\sum w_i(1-w_i)$ vanish on binary INITs, and why is a fitness that ignores $\pi$ allowed to "solve" a cipher that no FPGA can implement? Give a two-LUT numerical cartoon. Which clause of Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} did you just unpack?
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.3** (Seminar). Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} is structural, not complete. Write the statement of a completeness theorem you wish were true (melt recovers $X$ on netlist class $Y$ under schedule $Z$), and the counterexample shape you would try first. Do not upgrade shatter/hold grades into that theorem.

# Pillar III --- Adversarial Polymorphic Ciphers

## Ciphers that grow under fire {#ch:pillariii}

### Why a cryptanalysis lab must design ciphers

A course that only breaks historical machines trains curators. Pillar III asks Blue to sit in the same room as Red: mutate the non-linear feedback under adversarial pressure, and fail closed when the invariants break [@helut-enigma256; @helut-release].

The historical Enigma leaks this laboratory proved fatal---26-letter menus, self-stecker ban, thin plugboards, odometer stepping, paper day keys---are deleted on purpose in Enigma256 (E256). The reciprocal rotor *contract* is kept: encrypt $\equiv$ decrypt under the same machine state.

### The E256 contract, for lecture

- Alphabet is a byte, not 26 letters.

- Plugboard is a 256-entry involution, 128 pairs, no fixed points.

- Four active rotors drawn from a 16-rotor day pool; un-reflector allows fixed points.

- After each byte, NLFF step enables advance offsets; a Galois LFSR clocks. Not an odometer.

- Control-plane crypto (KEM, HKDF, AEAD, signatures) never enters datapath BRAMs.

- The live field is Apple Silicon SoftBus, not an FPGA board on the critical path.

### Theorem 2 (structural SoftBus) {#sec:thm-enigma256}

::: {#thm:enigma256 .theorem}
**Theorem 1.4** (Enigma256 SoftBus reciprocity / fail-closed). *Under the hypotheses of `Enigma256Formal.certificate()` (reciprocal scramble path; day-key involution builders; NLFF retaps do not rewrite frozen scramble): frozen scramble is a permutation and an involution; stream encrypt-then-decrypt recovers plaintext under identical keys; derived plugboard is fixed-point-free involution and un-reflector is an involution; `hardenedCubic()` rejects `coupledCubic6`.*
:::

Machine-checked: `Enigma256Formal.certificate()` / `testEnigma256FormalCertificate`. Reproduce: see Lab appendix / `REPRODUCE.md`.

::: warning
*Honesty note 1.4*. Theorem 2 is a *structural SoftBus contract*---not IND-CPA, not a claim that Red TensorLUT/KPA/`ent` cannot force Blue generation rolls, and not a finished polymorphic-cipher standard.
:::

### Red pressure

Red is not a separate team with a PDF of attacks. Red is TensorLUT cones, SoftBus known-plaintext attacks, and `ent` on the keystream---on the same Mac that rolls Blue generations.

A generation that cannot hold under that pressure does not ship. Fail-closed means: if reciprocity, bijection, or a stated invariant breaks, the roll aborts rather than emitting a "mostly fine" Verilog. Theorem 2 covers the structural abort path for coupled NLFF harden; empirical Red batteries remain separate grades.

### What students design

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.4** (Blue studio). Propose one additional invariant E256 should fail-closed on (example: NLFF period lower bound; stecker-free involution; BRAM burst width). Write the test that would refuse a generation. Do not implement a new cipher in this edition unless the instructor opens a project slot.
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.5** (Historical leaks as a checklist). Map each deleted Enigma leak to the E256 construct that replaces it. One table, six rows. Then add a seventh row: a leak this design may still have, labeled as a question, not a claim.
:::

### Relation to Pillars I and II

E256 is not evaluated as torus FHE in this edition's lecture arc. It is a SoftBus datapath with a Red TensorLUT arm. Putting E256 on the encrypted HELUT clock is a possible future lab, and a possible **N** if someone calls that lab "production messaging."

# Laboratory, Applications, and the Frontier

## Application gallery {#ch:apps}

Applications exist to keep pillars honest. A compiler with no netlist is a speech; a melt with no cipher is a float toy; a polymorphic cipher with no Red is a blog post.

Canonical nine-slot card: `directives/application-gallery.md`.

### Pillar I (encrypted)

1.  **Encrypted `full_adder` SING.** Multi-LUT correctness at production-shaped $N$ (**C6**, **C20**, **C21**).

2.  **Encrypted tree / regex SING.** Compiler is not adder-specialized (**C6**, demo $N$).

3.  **Hardness $+$ noisy-BK certificates.** Estimator fill-in and covering-gadget residuals (**C5**, **C22**, **C23**). Product-shaped $N{=}1024$ inject is a graded failure (**C26**); Metal SING still noiseless BK (**H4**).

4.  **Encrypted sequential.** Counter (**C38**), toy `NOP`/`ADD` (**C40**), PicoRV32 NOP-fetch at demo $N{=}8$ (**C47**; PC walks).

5.  **4-bit CSA vs ripple LUT cut** (**C42**). Architecture, not TensorLUT melt.

### Pillar I shape laboratory (oracle --- not FHE)

1.  **Decision tree.** A 4-bit non-linear boundary, 7 LUTs. Exact threshold logic on a batch of records. Teaches: non-linear Boolean $\neq$ neural net, and $B$ is a capacity knob.

2.  **Regex / DFA search.** 3-character matcher, 23 LUTs. Large $B$ turns unified memory into the story.

3.  **PicoRV32.** ${\sim}4.8\mathrm{k}$ LUTs, ${\sim}1.5\mathrm{k}$ DFFs. Scripted `resetn` boot. Oracle path: **C1**. Encrypted 1-tick at demo $N{=}8$: **C47** NOP-fetch (PC walks).

### Pillar II

1.  **M4 TensorLUT baseline emit** (**C8**).

2.  **Stecker involution sandwich / formal** (**C9**, **C19**, **C25**, **C44**, **C48**).

3.  **Shatter vs hold under $\lambda$** --- seminar empirics; not a decrypt (**H6**).

### Pillar III

1.  **SoftBus reciprocity / bijection** (**C10**, **C24**).

2.  **Encrypted 1-round frozen scramble** (**C39**) --- algebraic slice under torus FHE, not live BRAM.

3.  **Red battery** (TensorLUT / KPA / `ent`) --- empirical grades in `logs/enigma256-*`.

4.  **Fail-closed NLFF harden** (**C24** clause 5).

### Campaign as a case study (not a decrypt)

Welchman-path break of known P1030684 (**C2**), $\le 10$-plug SAT kill chain (**C3**), Potsdam/Plaice $\neq$ P1030680 (**C11**), windowed discriminator versus whole-message turnover (**C12**): these belong in a cryptanalysis seminar attached to Pillar II methods.

::: exercise
**Exercise 1.6**. Pick one application tier and write a five-cell card for it. If you cannot name two runnable instances, it is not ready for the gallery lecture.

## Laboratories {#ch:lab}

Systems-track labs assume macOS 14$+$, Apple Silicon, Swift 6.3, and a release `helut` at repo root: `swift build -c release --product helut`. Theory-track substitutes are stated per lab.

### Lab 0 --- Claim literacy (everyone)

Read `directives/claim-sheet.md` at the printed epoch. Classify five public sentences (instructor-provided) as **C**, **H**, **N**, or frontier. No machine required.

### Lab 1 --- Negacyclic oracle

Implement $N=8$ schoolbook mul in $\mathbb{Z}/2^{32}\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N+1)$ and check a dense Toeplitz expansion against it on torus corners. Theory track: $N=4$ by hand (Chapter [3](#ch:torus){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:torus"} exercises).

### Lab 2 --- Netlist clock

Compile `counter` or `full_adder` Yosys JSON with `--compile-only`. Tick with `--bench`. Identify $B$, $N$, LUT count, DFF count. Explain in writing why $N$ is not the circuit size.

### Lab 3 --- Boolean oracle versus FHE path

    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 64 \
      --lut-backend pbs --encoding phase --bench-equiv
    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    .build/release/helut --bench counter_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    .build/release/helut --bench toy_isa_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 32
    .build/release/helut --bench picorv32_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --ticks 32 --reset-hold 3 \
      --encrypted-mem nop --paths 'blind-rotate public-ms boolean'

Deliverable: a table with columns {backend, $N$, SING, certificates printed, may we say "encrypted" on a slide?}.

### Lab 4 --- Production-shaped SING

Follow Appendix [4](#app:repro){reference-type="ref" reference="app:repro"}. Record ms/row at $N=8$ and $N=1024$. Write the **H1** asterisk next to hardness. Write the **H4** asterisk next to depth: **C22** measured covering gadget; $N=1024$ SING is still $e=0$ BK.

Theory track: parse a published SING log and reconstruct the table without running Metal.

### Lab 4b --- Measured noisy BK (**C22**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 8 \
      --trials 8 --bk-noise 64

Deliverable: $B_{\mathrm{bk}}$, $\hat\sigma$, $\delta/2$, and one sentence on why $\ell=1$ `booleanPublicMS` is omitted. Theory track: read `logs/helut-noisy-bk-measure.log`.

### Lab 5 --- Metal compiler post-mortem

Compare fused-megagraph DNF, **C16**--**C21** using Chapter [2](#ch:metal){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:metal"}'s table. Optional systems: `make test-metal-p1` and one `--bench-encrypted-micro --degree 64` run. Deliverable: the **H3** paragraph in your own words (scheduler vs NTT).

### Lab 6 --- TensorLUT Theorem 1 (**C19**)

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTFormalCertificate

Deliverable: name the six lemmas, the certificate hypotheses, and one sentence that Theorem [1.1](#thm:tensorlut){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:tensorlut"} does *not* prove. Optional: `testTensorLUTMeltFreezeSnapCertificate` (**C44**) --- what class of INIT genomes the unique-maximizer lemma covers. Theory track: read `Sources/HELUTCore/TensorLUTFormal.swift` and `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md`; reconstruct the five-cell card without running Swift.

### Lab 7 --- Five-cell audit (everyone)

The signature assignment (Chapter [2](#ch:instructor){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:instructor"}). One abstract sentence from `paper/helut.tex`; five cells; a pass/fail on whether the sentence is lecture-safe at this epoch.

### Lab 8 --- Frontier proposal (everyone)

Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}: pick one avenue. Propose the first experiment that would mint a **C** row. You may not claim the avenue works.

### Optional project slots

TensorLUT involution sandwich replay (**C9** logs), E256 invariant studio, or a new Yosys netlist (student RTL $\to$ SING). Instructor approval required; campaign decrypt projects are out of scope.

## Open problems (trajectory) {#ch:open}

This chapter is the discovery path after disclosure [@helut-trajectory]. None of these items are lecture facts until they have receipts.

### Mid-term pillars

1.  **Pillar I science:** shallower nets, NTT/persist graphs, estimator-backed params (this book's Parts III).

2.  **Pillar II science:** Theorem 1 landed (**C19**); corollary emitter / freeze (**C25**); melt--freeze--snap on a separable interpolant (**C44**); 2-LUT cascade emit (**C48**); remaining: multi-LUT topological melt, stream-cipher melts.

3.  **Pillar III science:** SoftBus Theorem 2 landed (**C24**, Chapter [1](#ch:pillariii){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:pillariii"}); remaining: polymorphic Red/Blue standard beyond E256 SoftBus.

4.  **FHE gate / ZK depth:** TensorLUT aimed at multiplicative depth (queued; not a part of this edition).

5.  **Side-channel (parked):** bgpucap-style power on live Metal graphs only with controlled fixtures --- Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"}, avenue 5.

**Exercise 3.1** (Pick a next experiment). Choose one open hedge. Write a one-page lab proposal: command line, pass bar, which box in this book would change, and which **N** you refuse to imply if the experiment fails.

## Frontier (not claims) {#ch:frontier}

The text in this chapter is adapted from the project's speculative avenues [@helut-avenues]. It is included so the public story stays honest: **reproducible core now; weird frontier labeled as frontier.**

Instructors: last two seminars, or a 10% essay. Never a true/false bank.

### Encrypted LLM guardrails

First graduating experiment (suggested): a 4-LUT encrypted classifier SING on synthetic token bits, with a certificate, *before* any talk of genetic mutation or Ollama.

### Self-modifying encrypted binaries

First graduating experiment: encrypted instruction-fetch SING on a toy ISA smaller than PicoRV32, with a written ethics note. This is a privacy architecture problem, not a malware homework.

### Honey-token ledgers

First graduating experiment: regex netlist SING at modest $B$ with an explicit non-claim that the node learns nothing---then measure what the *host process* still sees (lengths, timings). Honesty before mesh networks.

### Genetic hardware synthesis

First graduating experiment: one offline generation of a 2-LUT netlist that SING-matches a fixed spec, wall-clock of synth$+$lower, no on-the-fly claims.

### Metal-tick power analysis (parked)

First graduating experiment: fixture harness that emits tick markers and a published "no analysis yet" log. Do not assign attacks against third-party graphs.

### Rules for frontier essays

1.  Label every paragraph frontier or first-experiment.

2.  Name the **C** row it would become, and the **N** it must not imply on the way.

3.  Cite Chapter [3](#ch:living){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:living"}. If the five cells cannot even be *imagined*, the essay is not ready.

### Standing non-implications

Do not let prose imply: new lattice assumption; "we invented TFHE"; production keys without estimator; mock-torus $=$ FHE; P1030680 decrypted; campaign fitness $=$ encrypted tick rate; TensorLUT $=$ U-534 break; side-channels measured; quantum attacks analyzed. Wild ideas in Chapter [4](#ch:frontier){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:frontier"} are trajectory, not results.

## Fifteen-week syllabus {#app:syllabus}

Suggested title: *Reconfigurable Homomorphic Computing*. 3 credits. Mix of lecture, seminar, and lab (Chapter [2](#ch:instructor){reference-type="ref" reference="ch:instructor"}).

## Reproduce commands (course subset) {#app:repro}

Canonical file: `REPRODUCE.md`. Cookbook: `directives/parameter-cookbook.md`. Build:

    swift build -c release --product helut

### Documents

    make textbook   # this book
    make paper      # three-pillar report
    make writeup    # P1030680 campaign report

### Hardness (**C23**, **H1**)

    .build/release/helut --hardness-table
    ./Scripts/helut_sage_estimate.sh

Native SageMath 10.9 at `~/Applications/SageMath-10-9.app`. Production row: HELUT $175.7$ vs estimator $180.2$. Four of eight anchors exceed the 16-bit merge tolerance --- do not quote $176$ as estimator cost on every row.

### Encrypted SING (**C4**--**C6**, **C38**--**C40**)

    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    ./Scripts/helut_encrypted_sing.sh
    .build/release/helut --bench counter_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 8
    .build/release/helut --bench e256_round1_netlist.json --degree 16 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 32
    .build/release/helut --bench toy_isa_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 32

**C38** counter, **C39** frozen E256 round (LUT4, $N\ge 16$), **C40** toy ISA. None of these is PicoRV32 or live BRAM SoftBus.

### Metal microbench and NTT (**C18**)

    make test-metal-p1
    .build/release/helut --bench-encrypted-micro --degree 1024 \
      --trials 2 --warmup 1

Default at $N>64$ is tiled-kernel with inlined NTT. Do not assign `--metal-br-fused` at $N=1024$ as a timed lab.

### Wavefront SING (**C20**, **C21**)

Boolean $10.6\,\mathrm{s}/8$; crypto $\ell=2$ $11.38\,\mathrm{s}/8$ at $N=1024$. Logs already in `logs/` --- students need not re-time Metal unless the instructor assigns a machine-local check.

    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 8 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal public-ms boolean'
    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 8 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal public-ms crypto'

### Measured noisy BK (**C22**)

Covering gadget only. $\ell=1$ `booleanPublicMS` cannot carry BK noise.

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 8 \
      --trials 8 --bk-noise 64
    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 128 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 64

### Product-shaped $N{=}1024$ residual (**C26**)

Graded negative for production noisy BK (H4). Expect undecodable inject $B{=}64$; $B{=}4$ on `.crypto` may pass $\infty$-norm with $\varepsilon\log_2\approx -1$ (not $-64$).

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 2 --bk-noise 64
    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 2 --bk-noise 4

### Exact public-MS covering (**C27**)

    swift test -c release --filter testGGSWPublicMSCoveringCertificate

Exact degrees among $\{8,\ldots,2048\}$: $\{8,128\}$ only --- for any power-of-two word $w$ (**C29**), not just $q{=}2^{32}$. Statement: `directives/ggsw-public-ms-covering.md`.

### Track B $\varepsilon$ vs inject $B$ (**C30**)

    for B in 1 2 4 8 16 32 64; do
      .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 128 \
        --trials 8 --bk-noise $B
    done

Residual amplification stays large; printed $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-24$ only at $B{=}64$.

### Incomplete public-MS gap / Track A approx (**C31**/**C32**)

    swift test -c release --filter testGGSWIncompleteCoveringCertificate
    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 1

uncoveredBits$(1024)=10$. `.crypto` $B{=}1$ $\Rightarrow\varepsilon\log_2\approx-8.4$ (8 trials). Statement: `directives/ggsw-incomplete-covering.md`.

### Track A Metal covering-crypto SING (**C33**)

    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 1 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal secret crypto'
    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 1 \
      --paths covering-crypto

Expect PASS; covering `.crypto`, not `cryptoPublicMS`.

### Track A covering-b4 $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$ (**C34**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 8 --bk-noise 1 --covering-base-log 4
    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 1 \
      --paths covering-b4

Expect $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-913$; Metal PASS. Torus-scale $B{=}128$ still fails.

### Track A covering-b2 $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$ through $B{=}16$ (**C35**)

    .build/release/helut-bench --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 16 --covering-base-log 2
    .build/release/helut-bench --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 16 \
      --paths covering-b2

Expect $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-65.4$ at $B{=}16$; Metal PASS. $B{=}32$ fails the bar.

### Track A covering-b1 $\varepsilon\le 2^{-64}$ through $B{=}32$ (**C36**)

    .build/release/helut-bench --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 \
      --trials 4 --bk-noise 32 --covering-base-log 1
    .build/release/helut-bench --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise 32 \
      --paths covering-b1

Expect $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-139$ at $B{=}32$; Metal PASS. $B{=}128$ still fails.

### Track A $\sigma{=}128$ covering-b1 at $N\le 512$ (**C41**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 512 --trials 4 \
      --bk-noise-sigma 128 --covering-base-log 1
    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 512 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths covering-b1

Does not close $N{=}1024$ at native $k{=}1$. Headroom is $\delta=q/(2N)$.

### $k\delta$ encoding at $N{=}1024$ (**C43**)

    .build/release/helut --measure-bk-noise --degree 1024 --trials 4 \
      --bk-noise-sigma 128 --covering-base-log 1 --boolean-scale-mul 4
    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 1024 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 2 --bk-noise-sigma 128 \
      --paths covering-b1 --boolean-scale-mul 4

$k{=}4$ Metal SING PASS; 4-trial $\varepsilon\log_2\approx-43$ (not $-64$). $k{=}8$ meets $\varepsilon$; public-ms SING fails.

### Track B Metal SING with noisy BK (**C28**)

    .build/release/helut --bench netlist.json --degree 128 \
      --bench-encrypted --sing --vectors 4 --bk-noise 64 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate-metal public-ms crypto'

Covering degree. Expect PASS and non-zero decodable $B_{\mathrm{bk}}$.

### TensorLUT Theorem 1 (**C19**)

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTFormalCertificate

Six lemmas must `hold`. Statement: `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md`. Not a U-534 / P1030680 decrypt.

### Enigma256 SoftBus Theorem 2 (**C24**)

    swift test -c release --filter testEnigma256FormalCertificate

Five lemmas must `hold`. Statement: `directives/enigma256-theorem.md`. Structural SoftBus contract---not IND-CPA.

### TensorLUT Theorem 1 corollary (**C25**)

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTFormalCorollaryCertificate

Emitter--discrete agreement and involution-under-freeze must `hold`. Statement: `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md` (corollary).

    swift test -c release --filter testTensorLUTMeltFreezeSnapCertificate

Three lemmas must `hold` (unique maximizer, snap basin, freeze). Statement: `directives/tensorlut-theorem.md` (Theorem 1$''$). Not multi-LUT topological melt.

### Encrypted PicoRV32 1-tick (**C45**)

    .build/release/helut --bench picorv32_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --vectors 1 \

    .build/release/helut --bench picorv32_netlist.json --degree 8 \
      --bench-encrypted --cpu-only --sing --ticks 10 --reset-hold 3 \
      --paths 'blind-rotate public-ms boolean' \
      | tee logs/helut-encrypted-n8-cpu-sing-picorv32-boot10.log

Expect PASS $0.972\,\mathrm{s}/10$, $Q\equiv$ clear. Idle memory. LUT-tax: $N{=}32$ ${\sim}819\,\mathrm{ms}$; $N{=}64$ ${\sim}4.35\,\mathrm{s}$.

### Encrypted PicoRV32 NOP-fetch (**C47**)

    .build/release/helut --bench picorv32_netlist.json --degree 8 \
